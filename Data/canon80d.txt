Safety Precautions
The following precautions are provided to prevent harm or injury to 
yourself and others. Make sure to thoroughly understand and follow 
these precautions before using the product.
If you experience any malfunctions, problems, or damage to the 
product, contact the nearest Canon Service Center or the dealer 
from whom you purchased the product.

 

 Warnings: Follow the warnings below. Otherwise, death or 

serious injuries may result.

 To prevent fire, excessive heat, chemical leakage, explosions, and electrical shock, 

follow the safeguards below:
• Do not use any batteries, power sources, or accessories not specified in the 
Instruction Manual. Do not use any home-made or modified batteries, or the 
product if it is damaged. 

• Do not short-circuit, disassemble, or modify the battery. Do not apply heat or 

solder to the battery. Do not expose the battery to fire or water. Do not subject the 
battery to strong physical shock.

• Do not insert the battery’s plus and minus ends incorrectly.
• Do not recharge the battery in temperatures outside the allowable charging 

(working) temperature range. Also, do not exceed the recharging time indicated in 
the Instruction Manual.

• Do not insert any foreign metallic objects into the electrical contacts of the camera, 

accessories, connecting cables, etc.

 When disposing of a battery, insulate the electrical contacts with tape. Contact with 

other metallic objects or batteries may cause a fire or an explosion.

 If excessive heat, smoke, or fumes are emitted when recharging the battery, 

immediately unplug the battery charger from the power outlet to stop recharging. 
Otherwise, it may cause a fire, heat damage, or electrical shock.

 If the battery leaks, changes color, deforms, or emits smoke or fumes, remove it 

immediately. Be careful not to get burned in the process. It may cause a fire, 
electrical shock or burns if you keep using it.

 Prevent any battery leakage from contacting your eyes, skin, and clothing. It can 

cause blindness or skin problems. If the battery leakage comes in contact with your 
eyes, skin, or clothing, flush the affected area with lots of clean water without rubbing 
it. See a physician immediately.

 Keep equipment out of the reach of children and infants, including when in use. Straps 
or cords may accidentally cause choking, electrical shock, or injury. Choking or injury 
may also occur if a child or infant accidentally swallows a camera part or accessory. If 
a child or infant swallows a part or accessory, consult a physician immediately.

 Do not use or store the equipment in dusty or humid places. Likewise, keep the battery 

away from metallic items and store it with its protective cover attached to prevent 
short-circuit. This is to prevent fire, excessive heat, electrical shock, and burns.
 Before using the camera inside an airplane or hospital, check if it is allowed. 
Electromagnetic waves emitted by the camera may interfere with the plane’s 
instruments or the hospital’s medical equipment.

 To prevent a fire and electrical shock, follow the safeguards below:

• Always insert the power plug all the way in.
• Do not handle a power plug with wet hands.
• When unplugging a power plug, grasp and pull the plug instead of the cord.
• Do not scratch, cut, or excessively bend the cord or put a heavy object on the 

cord. Also, do not twist or tie the cords.

• Do not connect too many power plugs to the same power outlet.
• Do not use a cord whose wire is broken or insulation is damaged.

 Unplug the power plug periodically and clean off the dust around the power outlet 

with a dry cloth. If the surrounding is dusty, humid, or oily, the dust on the power 
outlet may become moist and short-circuit the outlet, causing a fire.

 Do not connect the battery directly to an electrical outlet or a car’s cigarette lighter 

outlet. The battery may leak, generate excessive heat or explode, causing fire, 
burns, or injuries.

 A thorough explanation of how to use the product by an adult is required when the 

product is used by children. Supervise children while they are using the product. 
Incorrect usage may result in electrical shock or injury.

 Do not leave a lens or lens-attached camera in the sun without the lens cap 

attached. Otherwise, the lens may concentrate the sun’s rays and cause a fire.

 Do not cover or wrap the product with a cloth. Doing so may trap heat within and 

cause the casing to deform or catch fire.

 Be careful not to get the camera wet. If you drop the product in the water or if water 
or metal get inside the product, promptly remove the battery. This is to prevent fire, 
electrical shock, and burns.

 Do not use paint thinner, benzene, or other organic solvents to clean the product. 

Doing so may cause fire or a health hazard.

21

Safety Precautions

 

 Cautions: Follow the cautions below. Otherwise, physical injury 
 Do not use or store the product in a high-temperature location such as inside a car

under the hot sun. The product may become hot and cause burns. Doing so may 
also cause battery leakage or explosion, which will degrade the performance or 
shorten the life of the product.

 Do not carry the camera around when it is attached to a tripod. Doing so may cause 
an injury or an accident. Also make sure the tripod is sturdy enough to support the 
camera and lens.

 Do not leave the product in a low-temperature environment for an extended period of 

time. The product will become cold and may cause injury when touched.

 Do not fire the flash near the eyes. It may hurt the eyes.

22

Handling Precautions
Camera Care

 This camera is a precision instrument. Do not drop it or subject it to physical 

shock.

 The camera is not waterproof and cannot be used underwater.
 To maximize the camera’s dust- and drip- resistance, keep the terminal 

cover, battery compartment cover, card slot cover, and all other covers firmly 
closed.

 This camera is designed to be dust- and drip- resistant, in order to help 

prevent sand, dust, dirt, or water that falls on it unexpectedly from getting 
inside, but it is impossible to prevent dirt, dust, water, or salt from getting 
inside at all. As far as possible, do not allow dirt, dust, water, and salt to get 
on the camera.

 If water gets on the camera, wipe it off with a dry and clean cloth. If dirt, dust, 

or salt gets on the camera, wipe it off with a clean, well-wrung wet cloth.

 Using the camera in a location with large amounts of dirt or dust may cause 

a malfunction.

 Cleaning the camera after use is recommended. Allowing dirt, dust, water, or 

salt to remain on the camera may cause a malfunction.

 If you accidentally drop the camera into water or are concerned that 

moisture (water), dirt, dust, or salt may have gotten inside it, promptly 
consult the nearest Canon Service Center.

 Never leave the camera near anything having a strong magnetic field such 
as a magnet or electric motor. Also, avoid using or leaving the camera near 
anything emitting strong radio waves, such as a large antenna. Strong 
magnetic fields can cause camera misoperation or destroy image data.

 Do not leave the camera in excessive heat, such as in a car in direct 

sunlight. High temperatures can cause the camera to malfunction.

 The camera contains precision electronic circuitry. Never attempt to 

disassemble the camera yourself.

23

Handling Precautions

 Do not block the built-in flash or mirror operation with your finger, etc. Doing 

so may cause a malfunction.

 Use only a commercially-available blower to blow away dust when it adheres 

to the lens, viewfinder, reflex mirror, focusing screen, etc. Do not use 
cleaners that contain organic solvents to clean the camera body or lens. For 
stubborn dirt, take the camera to the nearest Canon Service Center.

 Do not touch the camera’s electrical contacts with your fingers. This is to 

prevent the contacts from corroding. Corroded contacts may cause camera 
malfunction.

 If the camera is suddenly brought in from the cold into a warm room, 
condensation may form on the camera and internal parts. To prevent 
condensation, first put the camera in a sealed plastic bag and let it adjust to 
the warmer temperature before taking it out of the bag.

 If condensation forms on the camera, do not use the camera. This is to avoid 

damaging the camera. If there is condensation, remove the lens, card and 
battery from the camera, and wait until condensation has evaporated before 
using the camera.

 If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery 

and store the camera in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location. Even while the 
camera is in storage, press the shutter button a few times once in a while to 
check that the camera is still working.

 Avoid storing the camera where there are chemicals that result in rust and 

corrosion such as in a chemical lab.

 If the camera has not been used for an extended period, test all its functions 
before using it. If you have not used the camera for some time or if there is 
an important shoot such as a foreign trip coming up, have the camera 
checked by your nearest Canon Service Center or check the camera 
yourself and make sure it is working properly.

 If you use continuous shooting, Live View shooting, or movie shooting for a 

prolonged period, the camera may become hot. This is not a malfunction.
 If there is a bright light source inside or outside the image area, ghosting 

may occur.

24

Handling Precautions

LCD Panel and LCD Monitor

 Although the LCD monitor is manufactured with very high precision 

technology with over 99.99% effective pixels, there may be a few dead pixels 
displaying only black or red, etc. among the remaining 0.01% or less pixels. 
Dead pixels are not a malfunction. They do not affect the images recorded.
 If the LCD monitor is left on for a prolonged period, screen burn-in may occur 

where you see remnants of what was displayed. However, this is only 
temporary and will disappear when the camera is left unused for a few days.
 The LCD monitor display may seem slow in low temperatures, or look black 

in high temperatures. It will return to normal at room temperature.

Cards

metallic.

To protect the card and its recorded data, note the following:
 Do not drop, bend, or wet the card. Do not subject it to excessive force, 

physical shock, or vibration.

 Do not touch the card’s electronic contacts with your fingers or anything 

 Do not affix any stickers, etc., on the card.
 Do not store or use the card near anything that has a strong magnetic field, 
such as a TV set, speakers, or magnets. Also avoid places prone to having 
static electricity.

 Do not leave the card in direct sunlight or near a heat source.
 Store the card in a case, etc.

Charging the Battery

Tips for Using the Battery and Charger

 Upon purchase, the battery is not fully charged.

Charge the battery before use.

 Recharge the battery on the day before or on the day it is to be used.
Even during storage, a charged battery will gradually drain and lose its capacity.

 After recharging the battery, detach it and disconnect the 

charger from the power outlet.

 You can attach the cover in a different 

orientation to indicate whether the battery 
has been recharged or not.
If the battery has been recharged, attach the 
cover so that the battery-shaped hole <V> is 
aligned over the blue sticker on the battery. If the battery is 
exhausted, attach the cover in the opposite orientation.

 When not using the camera, remove the battery.

If the battery is left in the camera for a prolonged period, a small amount 
of power current is released, resulting in excess discharge and shorter 
battery life. Store the battery with the protective cover attached. Storing 
the battery when it is fully charged may lower the battery’s performance.

 The battery charger can also be used in foreign countries.

The battery charger is compatible with a 100 V AC to 240 V AC 50/60 Hz 
power source. If necessary, attach a commercially-available plug adapter for 
the respective country or region. Do not attach any portable voltage 
transformer to the battery charger. Doing so can damage the battery charger.
 If the battery becomes exhausted quickly even after being fully 

charged, the battery has reached the end of its service life.
Check the battery’s recharge performance (p.452) and purchase a new battery.

 After disconnecting the charger’s power plug, do not touch the prongs for 

 If the battery’s remaining capacity (p.452) is 94% or higher, the battery 

approx. 10 sec.

will not be recharged.

Basic Shooting

This chapter explains how to use the Basic Zone modes 
on the Mode Dial for best results.
With Basic Zone modes, all you do is point and shoot, and the 
camera sets everything automatically (p.107, 460). Also, to 
prevent botched pictures due to misoperations, advanced 
shooting function settings cannot be changed.

A Fully Automatic Shooting (Scene Intelligent Auto)
<A> is a fully automatic mode. The camera analyzes the scene 
and sets the optimum settings automatically. It also adjusts focus 
automatically by detecting whether the subject is still or moving (p.81).

1 Set the Mode Dial to <A>.

 Turn the Mode Dial while holding 

down the lock release button at the 
center.

2 Aim the Area AF frame over the 

subject.
 All the AF points will be used to focus, 

and the camera will focus on the 
closest object.

 Aiming the center of the Area AF 
frame over the subject will make 
focusing easier.

3 Focus on the subject.

 Press the shutter button halfway. The 

lens elements will shift to focus.

 When achieving focus, the AF point 

that has achieved focus will be 
displayed. At the same time, the 
beeper will sound and the focus 
indicator <o> in the viewfinder will 
light up.

 In low light, the AF point(s) will light 

up briefly in red.

 If necessary, the built-in flash will be 

raised automatically.

4 Take the picture.

 Press the shutter button completely to 

take the picture.

 The captured image will be displayed 

for approx. 2 sec. on the LCD 
monitor.

 After you finish shooting, push down 

the built-in flash with your fingers.

The <A> mode makes the colors look more impressive in nature, outdoor, 
and sunset scenes. If you do not obtain the desired color tones, change the 
mode to a Creative Zone mode and select a Picture Style other than 
<D>, then shoot again (p.154).

FAQ

 The focus indicator <o> blinks and focus is not achieved.

Aim the Area AF frame over an area with good contrast, then press 
the shutter button halfway (p.50). If you are too close to the subject, 
move away and try again.

 When focus is achieved, the AF points do not light up in red.

The AF points light up in red only when focus is achieved in low-light 
conditions.

 Multiple AF points light up simultaneously.

Focus has been achieved at all those points. You can take the 
picture as long as an AF point covering the target subject is lighting 
up.

79

A Fully Automatic Shooting (Scene Intelligent Auto)

 The beeper continues to beep softly. (The focus indicator <o> 

does not light up.)
It indicates that the camera is focusing continuously on a moving 
subject. (The focus indicator <o> does not light up.) You can take 
sharp pictures of a moving subject.
Note that the focus lock (p.81) will not work in this case.

 Pressing the shutter button halfway does not focus on the 

subject.
If the focus mode switch on the lens is set to <MF> (manual focus), 
set it to <AF> (autofocus).

 The flash fired even though it was daylight.

For a backlit subject, the flash may fire to help lighten the subject’s 
dark areas. If you do not want the flash to fire, use the Quick Control 
to set [Built-in flash firing] to [b] (p.106) or set the <7> (Flash 
Off) mode and shoot (p.83).

 The built-in flash fired and the picture came out extremely 

bright.
Move further away from the subject and shoot. When shooting with 
flash, if the subject is too close to the camera, the picture may come 
out extremely bright (overexposure).

 In low light, the built-in flash fired a series of flashes.

Pressing the shutter button halfway may trigger the built-in flash to 
fire a series of flashes to assist autofocusing. This is called the AF-
assist beam. Its effective range is approx. 4 meters / 13.1 feet. The 
built-in flash will make a sound when firing continuously. This is 
normal and not a malfunction.

 When flash was used, the bottom part of the picture came out 

unnaturally dark.
The shadow of the lens barrel was captured in the picture because 
the subject was too close to the camera. Move further away from the 
subject and shoot. If a hood is attached to the lens, remove it before 
taking the flash picture.

80

A Full Auto Techniques (Scene Intelligent Auto)
Recomposing the Shot

Depending on the scene, position the subject toward the left or right to 
create a balanced background and good perspective.
In the <A> mode, pressing the shutter button halfway to focus on a 
still subject will lock the focus on that subject. Recompose the shot 
while keeping the shutter button pressed halfway, and then press the 
shutter button completely to take the picture. This is called “focus lock”. 
Focus lock is also possible in other Basic Zone modes (except <5> 
<C>).

Shooting a Moving Subject

In the <A> mode, if the subject moves (distance to camera changes) 
during or after focusing, AI Servo AF will take effect to focus on the 
subject continuously. (The beeper will continue beeping softly.) As long 
as you keep the Area AF frame positioned over the subject while 
pressing the shutter button halfway, the focusing will be continuous. 
When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button completely.

7 Disabling Flash
The camera analyzes the scene and sets the optimum settings 
automatically. In places where flash photography is prohibited such as 
in a museum or an aquarium, use the <7> (Flash Off) mode.

Shooting Tips

 Prevent camera shake if the numeric display (shutter speed) in 

the viewfinder blinks.
Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the 
viewfinder’s shutter speed display will blink. Hold the camera steady 
or use a tripod. When using a zoom lens, use a wide angle to reduce 
blur caused by camera shake even with handheld shooting.

 Take portraits without flash.

In low-light conditions, tell the subject to keep still until the picture is 
taken. Any movement by the subject during shooting may result in 
the subject being blurred in the picture.

P Shooting Food
When shooting food, use <P> (Food). The photo will look bright and 
appetizing. Also, depending on the light source, the reddish tinge will be 
suppressed in the pictures taken under tungsten lights, etc.

Shooting Tips

 Change the color tone.

You can change [Color tone]. To increase the food’s reddish tinge, 
set it toward [Warm]. Set it toward [Cool] if it looks too red.

 Avoid using flash.

If you use flash, the light may reflect off the dish or food and results 
in unnatural shadows. By default, <b> (Built-in flash off) is set. Try 
to prevent camera shake when shooting in low-light conditions.

 Since this mode lets you shoot the food in appetizing color tones, human 

subjects may be shot in an unsuitable skin tone.

 The warm color cast of subjects may fade.
 When multiple light sources are included on the screen, the warm color 

cast of the picture may not be lessened.

 If you use flash, the [Color tone] setting will switch to the standard.

89

C Shooting Children
When you want to continuously focus on and shoot children running 
around, use <C> (Kids). Skin tones will look healthy.

Shooting Tips

 Track the subject with the Area AF frame.

Press the shutter button halfway to start autofocusing in Area AF 
frame. During autofocusing, the beeper will continue beeping softly. 
If focus cannot be achieved, the focus indicator <o> will blink.

 Shoot continuously.

The default setting is <o> (High-speed continuous shooting*). 
When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button 
completely. If you hold down the shutter button, you can shoot 
continuously while maintaining autofocusing to capture changes in 
the subject’s facial expression and movement.
* Viewfinder shooting: max. approx. 7.0 shots/sec., Live View shooting: max. 

approx. 5.0 shots/sec.

 While the flash is recycling, “buSY” is displayed in the viewfinder and on 
the LCD panel, and a picture cannot be taken. Take the picture after this 
display turns off. During Live View shooting, “BUSY” is displayed on the 
LCD monitor, and you cannot view the subject.

 See the cautions on page 99.

90

x Shooting Candlelight Portraits
When shooting a human subject in candlelight, use <x> (Candlelight). 
The candlelight color tones will be retained in the photo.

Shooting Tips

 Use the center AF point to focus.

Aim the center AF point in the viewfinder over the subject, then shoot.
 Prevent camera shake if the numeric display (shutter speed) in 

the viewfinder blinks.
Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the 
viewfinder’s shutter speed display will blink. Hold the camera steady 
or use a tripod. When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to 
reduce blur caused by camera shake even while handholding the 
camera.

 Change the color tone.

You can change [Color tone]. To increase the candlelight’s reddish 
tinge, set it toward [Warm]. Set it toward [Cool] if it looks too red.

 Live View shooting cannot be used.
 The built-in flash will not fire. In low light, the AF-assist beam may be 

emitted (p.119).

 If you are using an external Speedlite, the Speedlite will fire.

91

6 Shooting Night Portraits (With a Tripod)
To shoot people at night and obtain a natural-looking night scene in the 
background, use the <6> (Night Portrait) mode. Using a tripod is 
recommended.

Shooting Tips

 Use a wide-angle lens and a tripod.

When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to obtain a wide 
night view. Also, use a tripod to prevent camera shake.

 Check the subject’s brightness.

Under low light, the built-in flash will fire automatically to obtain a 
good exposure of the subject.
It is recommended to play back the image after shooting to check 
the image brightness. If the subject looks dark, move nearer and 
shoot again.

 Also shoot in other shooting modes.

Since camera shake is prone to occur with night shots, shooting also 
with <A> and <F> is recommended.

 Tell the subject to keep still even after the flash fires.
 If you use the self-timer together with flash, the self-timer lamp will light 

up briefly after the picture is taken.

 See the cautions on page 99.

92

F Shooting Night Scenes (Handheld)
Using a tripod when shooting a night scene gives the best results. 
However, the <F> (Handheld Night Scene) mode enables you to shoot 
night scenes even while handholding the camera. In this shooting 
mode, four shots are taken continuously for each picture, and the 
resulting one image with reduced camera shake is recorded.

Shooting Tips

 Hold the camera firmly.

While shooting, hold the camera firmly and steadily. In this mode, 
four shots are aligned and merged into a single image. However, if 
there is significant misalignment in any of the four shots due to 
camera shake, they may not align properly in the final image.

 For shots of people, turn on the flash.

If you want to include people in the night scene shot, press the <Q> 
button to set <D> (Built-in flash on). To take a nice portrait, the first 
shot will use flash. Tell the subject not to move until all four 
continuous shots are taken.

 Compared to other shooting modes, the shooting range will be smaller.
 See the cautions on page 99.

93

G Shooting Backlit Scenes
When shooting a scene having both bright and dark areas, use the 
<G> (HDR Backlight Control) mode. When you take one picture in this 
mode, three continuous shots are taken at different exposures. This 
results in one image, with a wide tonal range, that has minimized the 
clipped shadows caused by backlighting.

Shooting Tips

 Hold the camera firmly.

While shooting, hold the camera firmly and steadily. In this mode, 
three shots are aligned and merged into a single image. However, if 
there is significant misalignment in any of the three shots due to 
camera shake, they may not align properly in the final image.

 Compared to other shooting modes, the shooting range will be smaller.
 Flash shooting is not possible. In low light, the AF-assist beam may be 

emitted (p.119).

 See the cautions on page 99.

HDR stands for High Dynamic Range.

94

2 Shooting Portraits
The <2> (Portrait) mode blurs the background to make the human 
subject stand out. It also makes skin tones and hair look softer.

Shooting Tips

 Select the location where the distance between the subject and 

the background is the farthest.
The further the distance between the subject and background, the 
more blurred the background will look. The subject will also stand 
out better against an uncluttered dark background.

 Use a telephoto lens.

If you have a zoom lens, use the telephoto end to fill the frame with 
the subject from the waist up. Move in closer if necessary.

 Focus on the face.

Check that the AF point covering the face lights up. For close-ups of 
the face, focus on the eyes.

The default setting is <i> (Low-speed continuous shooting). If you hold 
down the shutter button, you can shoot continuously (max. approx. 3.0 
shots/sec.) to capture changes in the subject’s facial expression and pose.

95

3 Shooting Landscapes
Use the <3> (Landscape) mode for wide scenery or to have 
everything in focus from near to far. For vivid blues and greens, and 
very sharp and crisp images.

Shooting Tips

 With a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end.

When using the wide-angle end of a zoom lens, objects near and far 
will be in focus better than at the telephoto end. It also adds breadth 
to landscapes.

 Shooting night scenes.

The <3> mode is also good for night scenes because it disables 
the built-in flash. When shooting night scenes, use a tripod to 
prevent camera shake.

 The built-in flash will not fire even in backlit or low-light conditions.
 If you are using an external Speedlite, the Speedlite will fire.

96

4 Shooting Close-ups
When you want to shoot flowers or small things up close, use the <4> 
(Close-up) mode. To make small things appear much larger, use a 
macro lens (sold separately).

Shooting Tips

 Use a simple background.

A simple background makes small objects such as flowers stand out 
better.

 Move in as close as possible to the subject.

Check the lens for its minimum focusing distance. Some lenses 
have indications such as <MACRO 0.39m/1.3ft> on them. The lens 
minimum focusing distance is measured from the <V> (focal 
plane) mark on the top of the camera to the subject. If you are too 
close to the subject, the focus indicator <o> will blink.
If you use the built-in flash and the bottom part of the picture comes 
out unnaturally dark, move away from the subject and try again.

 With a zoom lens, use the telephoto end.

If you have a zoom lens, using the telephoto end will make the 
subject look larger.

97

5 Shooting Moving Subjects
Use the <5> (Sports) mode to shoot a moving subject, such as a 
running person or a moving vehicle.

Shooting Tips

 Use a telephoto lens.

The use of a telephoto lens is recommended for shooting from a 
distance.

 Track the subject with the Area AF frame.

Press the shutter button halfway to start autofocusing in Area AF 
frame. During autofocusing, the beeper will continue beeping softly. 
If focus cannot be achieved, the focus indicator <o> will blink.
The default setting is <o> (High-speed continuous shooting*). 
When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button 
completely. If you hold down the shutter button, you can shoot 
continuously while maintaining autofocusing to capture changes in 
the subject’s movement.
* Viewfinder shooting: max. approx. 7.0 shots/sec., Live View shooting: max. 

approx. 5.0 shots/sec.
 The built-in flash will not fire even in backlit or low-light conditions.
 Under low light when camera shake tends to occur, the viewfinder’s shutter 
speed display on the bottom left will blink. Hold the camera steady and shoot.

 If you are using an external Speedlite, the Speedlite will fire.
 During Live View shooting, the image quality can be set to 1 or JPEG. 

If 41 or 61 is set, the image will be recorded in 1 quality.

98

Cautions for <C> Kids
 During Live View shooting, the image quality can be set to 1 or JPEG. 

If 41 or 61 is set, the image will be recorded in 1 quality.

 During Live View shooting, if flash is fired in continuous shooting, the 

continuous shooting speed will decrease. Even if the flash is not fired for 
subsequent shots, shooting will be performed with the decreased 
continuous shooting speed.

Cautions for <6> Night Portrait and <F> Handheld Night Scene
 During Live View shooting, it may be difficult to focus on dots of light 
such as in a night scene. In such a case, set the lens’s focus mode 
switch to <MF> and focus manually.

 The Live View image displayed will not look exactly the same as the 

actual image shot.

Cautions for <F> Handheld Night Scene and <G> HDR Backlight 
Control
 You cannot select RAW or RAW+JPEG. If RAW is set, the image will be 
recorded in the 73 quality. Also, if RAW+JPEG is set, the image will be 
recorded in the set JPEG quality.

 If you shoot a moving subject, the subject’s movement may leave 

afterimages, or the surrounding area of the subject may become dark.
 The image alignment may not function properly with repetitive patterns 
(lattice, stripes, etc.), flat or single-tone images, or images significantly 
misaligned due to camera shake.

 It takes some time to record images to the card since they are merged 

after shooting. During the processing of the images, “buSY” will be 
displayed in the viewfinder and on the LCD panel, and you cannot take 
another picture until the processing is completed.

Cautions for <6> Night Portrait
 During Live View shooting, it may be difficult to focus when the face of 
the subject looks dark. In such a case, set the lens’s focus mode switch 
to <MF> and focus manually.

99

Cautions for <F> Handheld Night Scene
 When shooting with flash, if the subject is too close to the camera, the 

picture may come out extremely bright (overexposure).

 If you use flash to shoot a night scene with few lights, the shots may not 

align correctly. This can result in a blurry picture.

 If you use flash and the human subject is close to the background that is also 
illuminated by the flash, the shots may not align correctly. This can result in a 
blurry picture. Unnatural shadows and unsuitable colors may also appear.

 External flash coverage:

• When using a Speedlite with automatic flash coverage setting, the zoom 

position will be fixed to the wide end, regardless of the lens’s zoom 
position.

• When using a Speedlite requiring manual flash coverage setting, set 

the flash head to the wide (normal) position.

Cautions for <G> HDR Backlight Control
 Note that the image may not be rendered with a smooth gradation and 

may look irregular or have significant noise.

 HDR Backlight Control may not be effective for excessively backlit 

scenes or extremely high-contrast scenes.

 When shooting subjects that are sufficiently bright, for example for 

normally lit scenes, the image may look unnatural because of the applied 
HDR effect.

v Applying Creative Filters
In the <v> (Creative filter) mode, you can apply one of ten filter effects 
(Grainy B/W*, Soft focus*, Fish-eye effect*, Toy camera effect*, 
Miniature effect*, Water painting effect*, HDR art standard, HDR art 
vivid, HDR art bold, and HDR art embossed) for shooting. When the 
camera is set for Live View shooting, you can see the effect on the 
screen before you start shooting. The camera saves only the image 
with the Creative filter applied.
For the effects marked with an asterisk, you can also take a picture without a 
Creative filter, then apply the effect afterward and save it as a new image (p.399).

Creative Filter Characteristics
 G Grainy B/W

Creates a grainy black-and-white photo. You can change the black-
and-white effect by adjusting the contrast.

 W Soft focus

Gives the image a soft look. You can change the degree of softness 
by adjusting the blur.

103

v Applying Creative Filters

 X Fish-eye effect

Gives the effect of a fish-eye lens. The image will have a barrel-type 
distortion.
Depending on the level of this filter effect, the area trimmed along the 
periphery of the image changes. Also, since this filter expands the 
center part of the image, the resolution at the center may decrease 
depending on the number of recorded pixels. Check the image on the 
screen when setting this filter. The AF point will be fixed at center.

 H Toy camera effect

Darkens the photo’s corners and applies a color tone that makes it 
look as if it was shot by a toy camera. You can change the color cast 
by adjusting the color tone.

 c Miniature effect

Creates a diorama effect.
During Live View shooting, you can change where the image looks 
sharp. In step 5, if you press the <u> button (or tap [T] on the 
bottom right of the screen), you can switch between the white 
frame’s vertical and horizontal orientations. The camera focuses on 
the center of the white frame.
During viewfinder shooting, aim the center AF point over the subject 
and shoot.

 Z Water painting effect

Makes the photo look like a watercolor painting with soft colors. You 
can control the color density by adjusting the filter effect. Note that 
night scenes or dark scenes may not be rendered with a smooth 
gradation and may look irregular or have significant noise.

 A HDR art standard

Clipped highlights and shadows will be reduced. The contrast will be 
lower, and the gradation flatter to have the picture look like a 
painting. The subject outlines will have bright (or dark) edges.

For <A> <B> <C> <D>, clipped highlights and shadows will be 
reduced for a high dynamic range of tones even with high-contrast scenes. 
Three images of different exposures are captured continuously for 
each shot and merged into a single image. See the cautions on page 105.

104

v Applying Creative Filters

 B HDR art vivid

 C HDR art bold

The colors are more saturated than with [HDR art standard], and 
the low contrast and flat gradation create a graphic art effect.

The colors are the most saturated, making the subject pop out, and 
the picture look like an oil painting.

 D HDR art embossed

The color saturation, brightness, contrast and gradation are 
decreased to make the picture look flat. The picture looks faded and 
old. The subject outlines will have bolder bright (or dark) edges.

Cautions for <A> HDR Art Standard, <B> HDR Art Vivid, <C> 
HDR Art Bold, and <D> HDR Art Embossed
 Compared to other shooting modes, the shooting range will be smaller.
 The Live View image displayed with the filter applied will not look exactly 

the same as the actual image.

 If you shoot a moving subject, the subject’s movement may leave 

afterimages, or the surrounding area of the subject may become dark.
 The image alignment may not function properly with repetitive patterns 
(lattice, stripes, etc.), flat or single-tone images, or images significantly 
misaligned due to camera shake.

 If you are handholding the camera, try to prevent camera shake when 

shooting.

 The color gradation of the sky or white walls may not be reproduced 

correctly. Irregular exposure, irregular colors, or noise may appear.

 Shooting under fluorescent or LED lighting may result in unnatural color 

reproduction of the illuminated areas.

 It takes some time to record images to the card since they are merged 

after shooting. During the processing of the images, “buSY” will be 
displayed in the viewfinder and on the LCD panel, and you cannot take 
another picture until the processing is completed.

 Flash shooting is not possible. In low light, the AF-assist beam may be 

emitted (p.119).

 If focus cannot be achieved, the focus indicator <o> in the viewfinder 
will blink. If this occurs, the picture cannot be taken even if the shutter 
button is pressed completely. Recompose the shot or see “When 
Autofocus Fails” (p.136) and try to focus again.

 If [z1: Beep] is set to [Disable], the beeper will not sound when focus 

is achieved.

 After achieving focus with One-Shot AF, you can lock the focus on a 

subject and recompose the shot. This is called “focus lock”. This is useful 
when you want to focus on a peripheral subject not covered by the Area 
AF frame.

 When a lens equipped with electronic manual focusing function is used, 

after achieving focus, you can focus manually by turning the lens 
focusing ring while pressing the shutter button halfway.

117

f: Selecting the AF OperationN

AI Servo AF for Moving Subjects
This AF operation is suited for moving subjects when the focusing 
distance keeps changing. While you hold down the shutter button 
halfway, the camera will keep focusing on the subject continuously.
 The exposure is set at the moment the picture is taken.
 When the AF area selection mode (p.120) is set to 45-point 

automatic selection AF, focus tracking will continue as long as the 
Area AF frame covers the subject.

With AI Servo AF, the beeper will not sound even when focus is achieved. 
Also, the focus indicator <o> in the viewfinder will not light up.

AI Focus AF for Switching the AF Operation Automatically
AI Focus AF switches the AF operation from One-Shot AF to AI 
Servo AF automatically if a still subject starts moving.
 After the subject is focused in One-Shot AF, if the subject starts 

moving, the camera will detect the movement, change the AF 
operation automatically to AI Servo AF, and start tracking the moving 
subject.

When focus is achieved with AI Focus AF with the Servo operation active, 
the beeper will continue beeping softly. However, the focus indicator <o> in 
the viewfinder will not light up. Note that focus will not be locked in this case.

118

AF Points Lighting Up in Red
By default, the AF points light up in red when focus is achieved in low-
light conditions. In Creative Zone modes, you can set whether to have 
the AF points light up in red when focus is achieved (p.424).

AF-Assist Beam with the Built-in Flash
Under low-light conditions, when you press the shutter button halfway, 
the built-in flash may fire a brief burst of flashes. This illuminates the 
subject to help autofocusing.

 AF-assist beam will not be emitted from the built-in flash in <7> or 

<8: C35> modes, or when [Built-in flash firing] is set to <b> 
in <A>, <C>, <8: PF24>, or <v: GWXHcZ> modes.

 The AF-assist beam will not be emitted with AI Servo AF operation.
 The built-in flash makes a sound when firing continuously. This is normal 

and not a malfunction.

 The effective range of the AF-assist beam emitted by the built-in flash is 

approx. 4 meters / 13.1 feet.

 In Creative Zone modes, when you raise the built-in flash with the <I> 
button, the AF-assist beam will fire when necessary. Note that depending 
on the setting for [8C.Fn II-6: AF-assist beam firing], the AF-assist 
beam may not be emitted (p.419).

o AF pt selected] (p.422), you can use this method to manually select 
the AI Servo’s AF initial position.

 When you press the <S> or <B> button, the LCD panel displays the 

following:
• Zone AF, Large Zone AF, and 45-point automatic selection AF: M AF
• 1 pt AF: SEL N (Center)/SEL AF (Off-center)

S Selecting the AF Area and AF PointN

AF Point Display Indications
Pressing the <S> or <B> button lights up the AF points that are 
cross-type AF points for high-precision autofocusing. The blinking AF 
points are horizontal-line or vertical-line sensitive. For details, see 
pages 127-131.

123

AF Area Selection Modes
S Single-point AF (Manual Selection)

 Select one AF point <S> to be used for focusing.

m Zone AF (Manual Selection of Zone)
The AF area is divided into nine focusing zones for focusing. All the AF 
points in the selected zone are used for the automatic AF point 
selection. It is superior to single-point AF in tracking the subject, and it 
is effective for moving subjects.
However, since it is inclined to focus on the nearest subject, focusing on 
a specific target may be more difficult.
The AF point(s) achieving focus is displayed as <S>.

n Large Zone AF (Manual Selection of Zone)
The AF area is divided into three focusing zones (left, center, and right) 
for focusing. Since the focusing area is larger than with Zone AF and all 
the AF points in the selected zone are used for the automatic AF point 
selection, it is superior to single-point AF in tracking the subject, and it is 
effective for moving subjects.
However, since it is inclined to focus on the nearest subject, focusing on 
a specific target may be more difficult.
The AF point(s) achieving focus is displayed as <S>.

124

AF Area Selection Modes

o 45-point Automatic Selection AF
The Area AF frame (entire AF area) is used to focus. This mode is set 
automatically in Basic Zone modes (except <8: x> and <v: 
Xc>).
The AF point(s) achieving focus is displayed as <S>.

 With One-Shot AF, pressing the shutter button 
halfway will display the AF point(s) <S> that 
achieved focus. If multiple AF points are 
displayed, it means they all have achieved focus. 
This mode tends to focus on the nearest subject.
 With AI Servo AF, you can set the AI Servo AF’s 
starting position with [8C.Fn II-11: Initial AFpt, 
o AI Servo AF] (p.422). As long as the Area AF 
frame can track the subject during shooting, 
focusing will continue.

 When AI Servo AF mode is set with 45-point automatic selection AF, 

Large Zone AF, or Zone AF, the active AF point <S> will keep switching 
to track the subject. However, under certain shooting conditions (such as 
when the subject is small), it may not be able to track the subject.

 If a peripheral AF point or a wide-angle lens is used, achieving focus may 
be difficult with an EOS-dedicated, external Speedlite’s AF-assist beam. 
In such a case, use an AF point closer to the center.

 When the AF point(s) light up, part or all of the viewfinder may light up in 

red. This is a characteristic of AF point display.

 In low temperatures, the AF point’s display may be difficult to see. This is 

a characteristic of AF point display. Also, the tracking response may 
become slower.

With [8C.Fn II -10: Orientation linked AF point], you can set the AF area 
selection mode + AF point, or only the AF point separately for the horizontal 
and vertical orientations (p.421).

125

AF Area Selection Modes

AF Using Color Tracking
By default, AF will be performed based on color tracking.
When the AF area selection mode is set to Zone AF, Large Zone AF, or 
45-point automatic selection AF, focus is achieved as follows:
 In One-Shot AF Mode

Focusing on a still human subject in the AF area is made easier.

 In AI Servo AF Mode

Focusing on a human subject in the AF area is made easier. If no skin 
tones can be detected, the nearest subject will be focused on. Once focus 
is achieved, AF points are automatically selected so that the camera 
continues to focus on the color of the area it focused on first.

* In [8C.FnII-12 Auto AF pt sel.:Color Tracking], you can set whether to perform 
AF by tracking colors. If [1: Disable] is set, focus is achieved based only on AF 
information (p.422).

126

AF Sensor
The camera’s AF sensor has 45 AF points. The illustration below shows 
the AF sensor pattern corresponding to each AF point. When using 
lenses with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or faster, high-precision AF is 
possible with the center AF point in the viewfinder.

Depending on the lens attached to the camera, the number of usable 
AF points, AF point patterns, the shape of Area AF frame, etc. vary. For 
details, see “Lenses and Usable AF Points” on page 128.

Diagram

Cross-type focusing: f/5.6 vertical + f/5.6 horizontal 

(also compatible with some f/8 lenses)

Dual cross-type focusing: 
f/2.8 right diagonal + f/2.8 left diagonal
f/5.6 vertical + f/5.6 horizontal 
(also compatible with f/8 lenses)

The focusing sensor is geared to obtain higher precision 
focusing for lenses with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or 
faster. A diagonal cross pattern makes it easier to focus on 
subjects difficult for AF. It is provided at the center AF point.
The focusing sensor is geared for lenses with a maximum 
aperture of f/5.6 or faster (and some f/8 lenses). Since it 
has a horizontal pattern, it can detect vertical lines. It 
covers all 45 AF points.

Lenses and Usable AF Points

 Although the camera has 45 AF points, the number of usable AF 
points and focusing patterns vary depending on the lens. The 
lenses are thereby classified into eight groups from A to H.

 When using a lens in Groups E to H, fewer AF points will be usable.
 See which group each lens belongs to on pages 132-135. Check 

which group the lens in use belongs to.

 The number of available AF points varies depending on aspect ratio 

settings (p.146).

 When you press the <S> or <B> button, the AF points indicated by 

 mark will blink. (The 

the 
lighting up or blinking of the AF points, see page 123.

 AF points will stay lit.) Regarding

 If Extender EF2x (I/II/III) is attached to the EF180mm f/3.5L Macro USM 

lens, AF is not possible.

 When using a lens and Extender EF1.4x III/EF2x III in a combination 

marked with an asterisk (*) or when using a lens and extender in a 
combination marked with two asterisks (**), precise focus may not be 
achieved with AF. In such a case, refer to the Instruction Manual of the 
lens or extender used.

If you use a TS-E lens, manual focusing will be required. The lens group 
designation of TS-E lenses applies only when you do not use tilt or shift 
function.

When Autofocus Fails
Autofocus may fail to achieve focus (viewfinder’s focus indicator <o> 
blinks) with certain subjects such as the following:
Subjects Difficult to Focus
 Subjects with very low contrast 

(Example: Blue skies, solid-color flat surfaces, etc.)

 Subjects in very low light
 Strongly backlit or reflective subjects 

(Example: Cars with highly reflective bodies, etc.)

 Near and distant subjects framed close to an AF point

(Example: Animals in cages, etc.)

 Subjects such as dots of light framed close to an AF point

(Example: Night scenes, etc.)

 Subjects with repetitive patterns

(Example: Skyscraper windows, computer keyboards, etc.)

In such a case, focus by doing either of the following:
(1) With One-Shot AF, focus on an object at the same distance as the 

subject and lock the focus, then recompose the shot (p.81).

(2) Set the lens’s focus mode switch to <MF> and focus manually 

(p.137).

 Depending on the subject, focus may be achieved by slightly 

recomposing the shot and performing AF operation again.

 Conditions that make focusing difficult with AF during Live View shooting 

or movie shooting are listed on page 284.

138

i Selecting the Drive Mode

 o: The maximum continuous shooting speed of approx. 7.0 shots/sec. 

is attained under the following conditions*: 1/500 sec. or faster shutter 
speed, maximum aperture (varies depending on the lens), Anti-flicker 
shooting set to Disable, with a fully-charged Battery Pack LP-E6N, and at 
room temperature (23°C/73°F). The continuous shooting speed may 
become slower depending on the shutter speed, aperture, subject 
conditions, brightness, lens, flash use, temperature, battery type, 
remaining battery level, etc.
* With the AF mode set to One-Shot AF and the Image Stabilizer turned off 
when using the following lenses: EF300mm f/4L IS USM, EF28-135mm f/3.5-
5.6 IS USM, EF75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM, EF100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS 
USM.

 If <B> or <M> is set, the time lag from when you press the shutter 

button completely until the picture is taken will be slightly longer than 
normal.

 With Live View shooting, <B> and <M> cannot be set.
 The continuous shooting speed may become slower if the remaining 

battery level is low or if you shoot under low-light conditions.

 In AI Servo AF operation, the continuous shooting speed may become 

slightly slower depending on the subject and the lens used.

 If you use Battery Grip BG-E14 (sold separately) with AA/R6 batteries, 

the high-speed continuous shooting speed may be slower.

 If you set [z4: Anti-flicker shoot.] to [Enable] (p.179) and shoot under 

a flickering light source, the continuous shooting speed may decrease 
slightly, the shooting interval may become irregular, or the release time 
lag may become longer.

 When internal memory becomes full during continuous shooting, the 

continuous shooting speed may drop since shooting will be temporarily 
disabled (p.145).

139

j Using the Self-timer
Use the self-timer when you want to be in the picture.

1 Press the <R> button (9).
2 Select the self-timer.

 While looking at the LCD panel, turn 
the <6> or <5> dial to select the 
self-timer delay.
Q : Shoot in approx. 10 sec.
k : Shoot in approx. 2 sec.

 Look through the viewfinder, focus on 

the subject, then press the shutter 
button completely.

 You can check the self-timer 

operation with the self-timer lamp, 
beeper, and countdown display (in 
seconds) on the LCD panel.

 2 sec. before the picture is taken, the 

self-timer lamp will light up and the 
beeper will sound faster.

If you do not look through the viewfinder when you press the shutter button, 
attach the eyepiece cover (p.220). If stray light enters the viewfinder when 
the picture is taken, it may throw off the exposure.

 The <k> enables you to shoot while not touching the camera 

mounted on a tripod. This prevents camera vibration blur when you shoot 
still lifes or long exposures.

 After taking self-timer shots, playing back the image (p.346) to check 

focus and exposure is recommended.

 When using the self-timer to shoot yourself, use focus lock (p.81) on an 

object at the same distance as where you will stand.

 To cancel the self-timer after it starts, either touch the LCD monitor or 

press the <R> button.

 b and c will be in 7 (Fine) quality.
 The file size, possible shots, and maximum burst during continuous shooting 

are based on Canon’s testing standards (3:2 aspect ratio, ISO 100 and 
Standard Picture Style) using an 8 GB card. These figures will vary 
depending on the subject, card brand, aspect ratio, ISO speed, Picture 
Style, Custom Functions, and other settings.

 The maximum burst applies to <o> high-speed continuous shooting. 

Figures in parentheses apply to an UHS-I class 16 GB card based on Canon’s 
testing standards.

Even if you use a UHS-I class card, the maximum burst indicator will not 
change. The maximum burst in parentheses in the table will apply instead.

143

3 Setting the Image-Recording Quality

 If you select both RAW and JPEG, the same image will be recorded 

simultaneously to the card in both RAW and JPEG at the image-
recording qualities that were set. The two images will be recorded with 
the same file numbers (file extension: .JPG for JPEG and .CR2 for 
RAW).

 The image-recording quality icons are as follows: 1 (RAW), 41 
(Middle RAW), 61 (Small RAW), JPEG, 7 (Fine), 8 (Normal), 3 
(Large), 4 (Middle), 6 (Small).

RAW Images
A RAW image is raw data output by the image sensor converted to 
digital data. It is recorded to the card as is, and you can select the 
quality as follows: 1, 41, or 61.
A 1 image can be processed with [31: RAW image processing] 
(p.390) and saved as a JPEG image. (41 and 61 images cannot 
be processed with the camera.) As the RAW image itself does not 
change, you can process the RAW image to create any number of 
JPEG images with various processing conditions.
You can use Digital Photo Professional (EOS software, p.512) to 
process RAW images. You can make various adjustments to images 
depending upon how they will be used and generate JPEG, TIFF, or 
other types of images reflecting the effects of those adjustments.

RAW Image Processing Software
 To display RAW images on a computer, using Digital Photo Professional 

(DPP, EOS software) is recommended.

 Previous versions of DPP Ver.4.x cannot process RAW images taken 

with this camera. If a previous version of DPP Ver.4.x is installed on your 
computer, obtain and install the latest version of DPP from the Canon 
Web site to update it (p.512). (The previous version will be overwritten.) 
Note that DPP Ver.3.x or earlier cannot process RAW images taken with 
this camera.

 Commercially-available software may not be able to display RAW 

images taken with this camera. For compatibility information, contact the 
software manufacturer.

144

3 Setting the Image-Recording Quality

Maximum Burst for Continuous Shooting

The approximate maximum burst is 
displayed on the bottom right in the 
viewfinder and on the shooting function 
settings screen.
If the maximum burst for continuous 
shooting is 99 or higher, “99” will be 
displayed.

The maximum burst is displayed even when a card is not inserted in the 
camera. Make sure that a card is inserted before taking a picture.

If the maximum burst is displayed as “99”, it indicates that you can shoot 99 
or more shots continuously. If the maximum burst decreases to 98 or lower 
and the internal buffer memory becomes full, “buSY” will be displayed in the 
viewfinder and on the LCD panel. Shooting will then be disabled temporarily. 
If you stop continuous shooting, the maximum burst will increase. After all 
the captured images are written to the card, you can resume continuous 
shooting and shoot up to the maximum burst listed in the table on page 143.
145

3 Changing the Image’s Aspect RatioN
You can change the image’s aspect ratio. [3:2] is set by default. When 
[4:3], [16:9], or [1:1] is set, frame lines indicating the shooting area will 
be displayed in the viewfinder. During Live View shooting, the image 
appears with the surrounding area masked in black on the LCD monitor.

<0>.

 JPEG images

The images will be saved with the set aspect ratio.

 RAW images

The images will always be saved with the [3:2] aspect ratio. The 
selected aspect ratio information is added to the RAW image file. 
When you process the RAW image with Digital Photo Professional 
(EOS software), this allows you to generate an image with the same 
aspect ratio set for shooting. In the case of the [4:3], [16:9], and [1:1] 
aspect ratios, the lines to indicate the aspect ratio will appear during 
image playback, but they are not actually drawn on the captured 
image.

The [z4: Aspect ratio] setting does not work with multiple exposures.

i: Setting the ISO Speed for Still PhotosN

 As “H” (equivalent to ISO 25600) is an expanded ISO speed setting, 

noise (dots of light, banding, etc.) and irregular colors will be more 
noticeable, and the resolution will be lower compared with the standard 
setting.

 If [z3: Highlight tone priority] is set to [Enable], ISO 100/125/160 and 

“H” (equivalent to ISO 25600) cannot be selected (p.174).

 Shooting in high temperatures may result in images that look grainier. 

Long exposures can also cause irregular colors in the image.

 When you shoot at high ISO speeds, noise (such as dots of light and 

banding) may become noticeable.

 When shooting in conditions that produce an extreme amount of noise, 
such as a combination of high ISO speed, high temperature, and long 
exposure, images may not be recorded properly.

 If you use a high ISO speed and flash to shoot a close subject, 

overexposure may result. 

You can expand the settable ISO speed range up to ISO 25600 (H)-
equivalent with [Range for stills] under  [z2: ISO speed settings] 
(p.151).

 If a correct exposure cannot be obtained with the maximum ISO speed 
limit set with [Auto range], a shutter speed slower than the [Min. shutter 
spd.] will be set to obtain a standard exposure.

 This function will not be applied to flash and movie shooting.

When [Auto: 0] is set, the minimum shutter speed will be the reciprocal of 
the lens focal length. A single step from [Slower] to [Faster] is equivalent to 
a single shutter speed stop.

3 Setting the White BalanceN
White balance (WB) is for making the white areas look white. Normally, 
the Auto [Q] (Ambience priority) or [Qw] (White priority) setting will 
obtain the correct white balance. If natural-looking colors cannot be 
obtained with Auto, you can select the white balance to match the light 
source or set it manually by shooting a white object.
In Basic Zone modes, [Q] (Ambience priority) is set automatically. (In 
the <P> mode, [Qw] (White priority) is set.)

3 Setting the White BalanceN

White Balance
To the human eye, a white object looks white regardless of the type of 
lighting. With a digital camera, the white for color correction basis is 
decided depending on the color temperature of the illumination, and 
then the color is adjusted with software to make the white areas look 
white. With this function, pictures with natural color tones can be taken.

Q Setting the Auto White Balance
With [Q] (Ambience priority), you can increase the intensity of the 
image’s warm color cast when shooting a tungsten-light scene. If you 
select [Qw] (White priority), you can reduce the intensity of the 
image’s warm color cast.
If you want to match the Auto white balance of previous EOS DIGITAL 
camera models, select [Q] (Ambience priority).

3 Setting the White BalanceN

Cautions for Setting [Qw] (White priority)
 The warm color cast of subjects may fade.
 When multiple light sources are included on the screen, the warm color 

cast of the picture may not be lessened.

 When using flash, the color tone will be the same as [Q] (Ambience 

priority).

O Custom White Balance
Custom white balance enables you to manually set the white balance 
for a specific light source. Make sure to perform this procedure under 
the light source at the actual location of the shoot.

1 Shoot a white object.

 Look through the viewfinder and aim 

the entire dotted line box (shown in the 
illustration) over a plain, white object.
 Focus manually and shoot with the 
standard exposure set for the white 
object.

 You can use any white balance setting.

 Under the [z2] tab, select [White 
5 Select the custom white balance.

 Select [O], then press <0>.

 If the exposure obtained in step 1 differs greatly from the standard 

exposure, a correct white balance may not be obtained.

 In step 3, the following images cannot be selected: Images captured with 
the Picture Style set to [Monochrome], images shot with a Creative filter, 
images processed with a Creative filter after shooting, multiple-exposure 
images, cropped images, and images shot with another camera.

 Instead of a white object, a gray chart or 18% gray reflector 

(commercially-available) can produce a more accurate white balance.

 The personal white balance registered with EOS Utility (EOS software) 

will be registered under [O]. If you perform step 3, the data for the 
registered personal white balance will be erased.

165

3 Setting the White BalanceN

P Setting the Color Temperature
You can set the white balance’s color temperature numerically. This 
function is for advanced users.

1 Select [White balance].

 Under the [z2] tab, select [White 

balance], then press <0>.

2 Set the color temperature.

 Select [P].
 Turn the <6> dial to set the color 

temperature, then press <0>.

 The color temperature can be set 
from approx. 2500 K to 10000 K in 
100 K increments.

 When setting the color temperature for an artificial light source, set white 

balance correction (magenta or green) as necessary.

 If you set [P] to the reading taken with a commercially-available color 

temperature meter, take test shots and adjust the setting to compensate 
for the difference between the color temperature meter’s reading and the 
camera’s color temperature reading.

166

3 White Balance CorrectionN
You can correct the white balance that is set. This adjustment will have 
the same effect as using a commercially-available color temperature 
conversion filter or color compensating filter. Each color can be 
corrected to one of nine levels.
This function is for advanced users, particularly for those users who 
understand the use of color temperature conversion and color 
compensating filters and their effects.

Shift/Bkt.], then press <0>.

Sample setting: A2, G1

2 Set the white balance correction.

 Use <9> to move the “ ” mark to the 

appropriate position.

 B is for blue, A for amber, M for 
magenta, and G for green. The 
image’s color balance will be adjusted 
toward the color in the direction of the 
move.

 On the right of the screen, “Shift” 

indicates the direction and correction 
amount, respectively.

 Pressing the <L> button will cancel 

all the [WB Shift/Bkt.] settings.

 Press <0> to exit the setting and 

return to the menu.

 You can display <z> in the viewfinder when white balance correction is 

set (p.425).

of a color temperature conversion filter. (Mired: Measuring unit indicating 
the density of a color temperature conversion filter.)

167

3 White Balance CorrectionN

White Balance Auto Bracketing
With just one shot, three images with different color tones can be 
recorded simultaneously. Based on the color temperature of the current 
white balance setting, the image will be bracketed with a blue/amber 
bias and magenta/green bias. This function is called white balance 
bracketing (WB Bkt.). White balance bracketing is possible up to ±3 
levels in single-level increments.

B/A bias ±3 levels

Set the white balance bracketing amount.
 In step 2 for “White Balance 

Correction”, when you turn the <5> 
dial, the “ ” mark on the screen will 
change to “     ” (3 points).
Turning the dial to the right sets the B/
A bracketing, and turning it to the left 
sets the M/G bracketing.

 On the right, “Bracket” indicates the 

bracketing direction and correction 
amount.

 Pressing the <L> button will cancel 

all the [WB Shift/Bkt.] settings.

 Press <0> to exit the setting and 

return to the menu.

 You can also set white balance correction and AEB together with white 

balance bracketing. If you set AEB in combination with white balance 
bracketing, a total of nine images will be recorded for a single shot.

 You can change the number of shots for white balance bracketing (p.414).
 “Bkt.” stands for bracketing.

168

3 Auto Correction of Brightness and ContrastN
If the image comes out dark or the contrast is low, the brightness and 
contrast can be corrected automatically. This function is called Auto 
Lighting Optimizer. The default setting is [Standard]. With JPEG 
images, the correction is applied when the image is captured.
In Basic Zone modes, [Standard] is set automatically.

1 Select [Auto Lighting Optimizer].
 Under the [z2] tab, select [Auto 
Lighting Optimizer], then press 
<0>.

2 Select the setting.

 Select the desired setting, then press 

<0>.

3 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with the 
brightness and contrast corrected if 
necessary.

 Depending on the shooting conditions, noise may increase.
 If a setting other than [Disable] is set and you use exposure 

compensation or flash exposure compensation to darken the exposure, 
the image may still come out bright. If you want a darker exposure, set 
this function to [Disable].

 If HDR mode (p.207), highlight tone priority (p.174), or multiple-exposure 

shooting (p.212) is set, the Auto Lighting Optimizer will be set 
automatically to [Disable].

In step 2, if you press the <B> button and uncheck [X] the [Disabled in 
M or B modes] setting, the [Auto Lighting Optimizer] can also be set in 
the <a> and <F> modes.

169

3 Setting Noise ReductionN
High ISO Speed Noise Reduction
This function reduces the noise generated in the image. Although noise 
reduction is applied at all ISO speeds, it is particularly effective at high 
ISO speeds. When shooting at low ISO speeds, the noise in the darker 
parts of the image (shadow areas) can further be reduced.

1 Select [High ISO speed NR].
speed NR], then press <0>.

 Under the [z3] tab, select [High ISO 

2 Set the level.

 Select the desired noise reduction 

level, then press <0>.

 M: Multi Shot Noise Reduction

This applies noise reduction with higher image quality than [High]. 
For a single photo, four shots are taken continuously and aligned 
and merged automatically into a single JPEG image.
If the image-recording quality is set to RAW or RAW+JPEG, you 
cannot set [Multi Shot Noise Reduction].

3 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with noise 

reduction applied.

When Multi Shot Noise Reduction is set, you can display <z> in the 
viewfinder (p.425).

170

3 Setting Noise ReductionN

Cautions for Setting Multi Shot Noise Reduction
 If there is significant misalignment in the image due to camera shake, the 

noise reduction effect may become smaller.

 If you are handholding the camera, keep it steady to prevent camera 

shake. Using a tripod is recommended.

 If you shoot a moving subject, the moving subject may leave 

afterimages.

 The image alignment may not function properly with repetitive patterns 

(lattice, stripes, etc.) or flat, single-tone images.

 If the subject’s brightness changes as the four consecutive shots are 

taken, irregular exposure in the image may result.

 After shooting, it may take some time to record an image to the card for 
noise reduction and merging the images. During the processing of the 
images, “buSY” will be displayed in the viewfinder and on the LCD panel, 
and you cannot take another picture until the processing is completed.

 You cannot use AEB and WB bracketing.
 If [z3: Long exp. noise reduction], [z3: Multiple exposure], [z3: 

HDR Mode], AEB, or WB bracketing is set, [Multi Shot Noise 
Reduction] cannot be set.

 You cannot set [Multi Shot Noise Reduction] for bulb exposures or 

movie shooting.

 Flash shooting is not possible. The AF-assist beam will be emitted 

according to the [8 C.Fn II -6: AF-assist beam firing] setting.

 If you turn off the power, change the shooting mode to a Basic Zone 

mode or <F>, or switch to movie shooting, the setting will automatically 
switch to [Standard].

171

3 Setting Noise ReductionN

Long Exposure Noise Reduction
Noise reduction is possible with images exposed for 1 sec. or longer.

1 Select [Long exp. noise 

reduction].
 Under the [z3] tab, select [Long 
exp. noise reduction], then press 
<0>.

2 Set the desired setting.

 Select the desired setting, then press 

<0>.

 Auto

For exposures of 1 sec. or longer, noise reduction is performed 
automatically if noise typical of long exposures is detected. This 
[Auto] setting is effective in most cases.

 Enable

Noise reduction is performed for all exposures of 1 sec. or longer. 
The [Enable] setting may reduce noise that cannot be detected with 
the [Auto] setting.

3 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with noise 

reduction applied.

172

3 Setting Noise ReductionN

 With [Auto] and [Enable], the noise reduction process after the picture is 

taken may take the same amount of time as that for the exposure. You 
cannot take another picture until the noise reduction process is 
completed.

 Images taken at ISO 1600 or higher may look grainier with the [Enable] 

setting than with the [Disable] or [Auto] setting.

 With [Enable], if a long exposure is shot with the Live View image 

displayed, “BUSY” will be displayed during the noise reduction process. 
The Live View display will not appear until the noise reduction is 
completed. (You cannot take another picture.)

173

3 Highlight Tone PriorityN
You can reduce overexposed, clipped highlights.

1 Select [Highlight tone priority].

 Under the [z3] tab, select 

[Highlight tone priority], then press 
<0>.

2 Select [Enable].

 Highlight details are improved. The 

dynamic range is expanded from the 
standard 18% gray to bright 
highlights. The gradation between the 
grays and highlights becomes 
smoother.

3 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with 

highlight tone priority applied.

 When [Enable] is set, noise may increase slightly.
 With [Enable], the settable ISO speed range will be ISO 200 or higher. 

Expanded ISO speed cannot be set.

If highlight tone priority is set, <A> is displayed in the viewfinder and on 
the LCD panel.

174

3 Correction of Lens Peripheral Illumination and AberrationsN
Peripheral light fall-off is a phenomenon that makes the image corners 
look darker due to the lens characteristics. Color fringing along subject 
outlines is called chromatic aberration. And image distortion due to lens 
characteristics is called distortion. These lens aberrations and light 
falloff can be corrected. By default, Peripheral illumination and 
Chromatic aberration correction are set to [Enable], and Distortion 
correction is set to [Disable].
If [F Correction data not available] is displayed, see “Lens Correction 
Data” on page 177.

Peripheral Illumination Correction

1 Select [Lens aberration 

correction].
 Under the [z1] tab, select [Lens 

aberration correction], then press 
<0>.

2 Select the setting.

 Check that [Correction data 
available] is displayed for the 
attached lens.

 Select [Peripheral illumin.], then 

press <0>.

 Select [Enable], then press <0>.

3 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with the 

peripheral illumination corrected.

Depending on shooting conditions, noise may appear on the image periphery.

 The correction amount applied will be lower than the maximum correction amount 

that can be applied with Digital Photo Professional (EOS software, p.512).
 The higher the ISO speed, the lower the correction amount will be.
 In Basic Zone modes, the peripheral illumination correction and 

chromatic aberration correction will be applied automatically. Distortion 
correction will not be applied.

175

3 Correction of Lens Peripheral Illumination and AberrationsN

Chromatic Aberration Correction

1 Select the setting.

 Check that [Correction data 
available] is displayed for the 
attached lens.

 Select [Chromatic aberration], then 

press <0>.

 Select [Enable], then press <0>.

2 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with the 

chromatic aberration corrected.

Distortion Correction

1 Select the setting.

 Check that [Correction data 
available] is displayed for the 
attached lens.

 Select [Distortion correction], then 

press <0>.

 Select [Enable], then press <0>.

2 Take the picture.

 The image will be recorded with the 

distortion corrected.

176

3 Correction of Lens Peripheral Illumination and AberrationsN

 When distortion correction is enabled, the camera records an image 

range narrower than the one seen through the viewfinder. (Image 
periphery will be slightly trimmed and resolution slightly lowered.)

 Distortion correction will be reflected in the captured image, but not in the 

viewfinder or Live View image during shooting.

 If you set [Distortion correction] to [Enable], the maximum burst 

(p.145) during continuous shooting will decrease.

 Distortion will not be corrected if you shoot a movie or set the HDR 

mode, multiple exposures, or Multi Shot Noise Reduction.

 Using distortion correction during Live View shooting will slightly affect 

the angle of view.

 AF point display information (p.352) and Dust Delete Data (p.405) will 
not be appended to images recorded with distortion correction applied.

Lens Correction Data
The camera already contains data for lens peripheral illumination 
correction, chromatic aberration correction, and distortion correction for 
approx. 30 lenses. If you select [Enable], the peripheral illumination 
correction, chromatic aberration correction, and distortion correction will 
be applied automatically for any lens whose correction data is 
registered in the camera.
With EOS Utility (EOS software), you can check which lenses have their 
correction data registered in the camera. You can also register the 
correction data for unregistered lenses. For details, refer to the EOS 
Utility Instruction Manual.
For lenses incorporating the correction data, it is not necessary to 
register the correction data to the camera.

177

3 Correction of Lens Peripheral Illumination and AberrationsN

Cautions for Lens Correction
 Peripheral illumination correction, chromatic aberration correction, and 
distortion correction cannot be applied to JPEG images already taken.
 When using a non-Canon lens, setting the corrections to [Disable] is 

recommended, even if [Correction data available] is displayed.

 If you use the magnified view during Live View shooting, the peripheral 
illumination correction will not be reflected in the image displayed on the 
screen.

 The correction amount will be less if the lens used does not have 

distance information.

Notes for Lens Correction
 If the effect of the correction is not visible, magnify the image after

Converter is attached.

 If the correction data for the attached lens is not registered to the 

camera, the result will be the same as when the correction is set to 
[Disable].

178

3 Reducing FlickerN
If you shoot an image with a fast shutter speed under a light source 
such as fluorescent light, the blinking of the light source causes flicker 
and the image may be vertically unevenly exposed. If continuous 
shooting is used under these conditions, uneven exposures or colors 
across the images may result. When you use this feature during 
viewfinder shooting, the camera detects the frequency of the light 
source’s blinking and takes the picture when the flicker causes less 
effect on exposure or color tone.

1 Select [Anti-flicker shoot.].

 Under the [z4] tab, select [Anti-
flicker shoot.], then press <0>.

2 Select [Enable].
3 Take the picture.

 The image will be taken with reduced 
unevenness of exposure or color tone 
caused by the flicker.

 When [Enable] is set and you shoot under a flickering light source, the 

shutter-release time lag may become longer. Also, the continuous 
shooting speed may become slower, and the shooting interval may 
become irregular.

 This function does not work with Live View shooting or movie shooting.
 In the <d> or <f> mode, if the shutter speed changes during continuous 
shooting or if you shoot multiple shots of the same scene at different shutter 
speeds, the color tone may be inconsistent. To avoid inconsistent color 
tones, use the <s> or <a> mode at a fixed shutter speed.

 The color tone of images shot when [Anti-flicker shoot.] is set to 

[Enable] may look different from when [Disable] is set.

 Flicker at a frequency other than 100 Hz or 120 Hz cannot be detected. 

Also, if the flickering frequency of the light source changes during 
continuous shooting, effects of the flicker cannot be reduced.

179

3 Reducing FlickerN

 If the subject is against a dark background or if there is a bright light in 

the image, flicker may not be properly detected.

 Under certain special types of lighting, the camera may not be able to 

reduce the effects of the flicker even when <G> is displayed in the 
viewfinder.

 Depending on the light source, flicker may not be detected properly.
 If you recompose a shot, <G> may appear and disappear 

intermittently.

 Depending on the light sources or shooting conditions, expected result 

may not be obtained even if you use this function.

 Taking test shots in advance is recommended.
 If <G> is not displayed in the viewfinder, under [52: Viewfinder 

display], set [Flicker detection] to [Show] (p.74). When the camera 
reduces the effects of the flicker when you shoot, <G> will light 
up. Under a light source which does not flicker, or if no flicker is detected, 
<G> will not be displayed.

 If [Flicker detection] is set to [Show] and [Anti-flicker shoot.] is set to 
[Disable], metering under a flickering light source will cause <G> 
to blink in the viewfinder as a warning. Setting [Enable] before shooting 
is recommended.

 In Basic Zone modes, <G> will not be displayed, but the effects of 

flicker will be reduced when you shoot.

 Anti-flicker shooting also works with flash. However, the expected result 

may not be obtained during wireless flash shooting.

180

3 Setting the Color SpaceN
The range of reproducible colors is called “color space”. With this 
camera, you can set the color space for captured images to sRGB or 
Adobe RGB. For normal shooting, sRGB is recommended.
In Basic Zone modes, sRGB is set automatically.

1 Select [Color space].

 Under the [z2] tab, select [Color 

space], then press <0>.

2 Set the desired color space.

 Select [sRGB] or [Adobe RGB], then 

press <0>.

Adobe RGB
This color space is mainly used for commercial printing and other 
industrial uses. This setting is not recommended if you are not familiar 
with image processing, Adobe RGB, and Design rule for Camera File 
System 2.0 (Exif 2.21 or higher). The image will look very subdued in a 
sRGB computer environment and with printers not compliant to Design 
rule for Camera File System 2.0 (Exif 2.21 or higher). Post-processing 
of the image with computer software will therefore be required.

 If the captured still photo was shot in the Adobe RGB color space, the 

first character in the file name will be an underscore “_”.

 The ICC profile is not appended. For explanations about the ICC profile, 

refer to the Digital Photo Professional Instruction Manual.

3 Creating and Selecting a Folder
You can freely create and select the folder where the captured images 
are to be saved.
This operation is optional since a folder will be created automatically for 
saving captured images.

1 Select [Select folder].

 Under the [51] tab, select [Select 

folder], then press <0>.

2 Select [Create folder].

3 Select [OK].

 A new folder with the folder number 

increased by one is created.

Folders
As with “100CANON” for example, the folder name starts with three digits 
(the folder number) followed by five alphanumeric characters. A folder can 
contain up to 9999 images (file number 0001 - 9999). When a folder 
becomes full, a new folder with the folder number increased by one is 
created automatically. Also, if manual reset (p.185) is executed, a new 
folder will be created automatically. Folders numbered from 100 to 999 can 
be created.
Creating Folders with a Computer
With the card open on the screen, create a new folder named “DCIM”. Open 
the DCIM folder and create as many folders as necessary to save and 
organize your images. The folder name must follow the format 
“100ABC_D”. The first three digits are the folder number, from 100 to 999. 
The last five characters can be any combination of upper- and lower-case 
letters from A to Z, numerals, and the underscore “_”. The space cannot be 
used. Also note that two folder names cannot share the same three-digit 
folder number (for example, “100ABC_D” and “100W_XYZ”), even if the last 
five characters in each name are different.

183

3 File Numbering Methods
The image files will be numbered from 
0001 to 9999 in the order the images are 
taken, then saved in a folder. You can 
change how the file number is assigned.

(Example) IMG_0001.JPG

File number

1 Select [File numbering].

 Under the [51] tab, select [File 
numbering], then press <0>.

2 Select the file numbering method.

 Select the desired setting, then press 

<0>.

Continuous
Continues the file numbering sequence even after the card is 
replaced or a new folder is created.
Even after you replace the card or create a new folder, the file 
numbering continues in sequence up to 9999. This is useful when you 
want to save images numbered anywhere between 0001 to 9999 on 
multiple cards or in multiple folders into one folder on a computer.
If the replacement card or existing folder already contains images 
recorded previously, the file numbering of the new images may continue 
from the file numbering of the existing images on the card or in the 
folder. If you want to use continuous file numbering, it is recommended 
that you use a newly formatted card each time.

3 File Numbering Methods

Auto Reset
Restarts the file numbering from 0001 each time the card is 
replaced or a new folder is created.
When you replace the card or create a folder, the file numbering restarts 
from 0001 for the new images saved. This is useful if you want to 
organize images by cards or folders.
If the replacement card or existing folder already contains images 
recorded previously, the file numbering of the new images may continue 
from the file numbering of the existing images on the card or in the 
folder. If you want to save images with the file numbering starting from 
0001, use a newly formatted card each time.

Manual Reset
Resets the file numbering to 0001 or to start from file number 0001 
in a new folder.
When you reset the file numbering manually, a new folder is created 
automatically and the file numbering of images saved to that folder 
starts from 0001.
This is useful, for example, when you want to use different folders for 
the images taken yesterday and the ones taken today.

If the file number in folder 999 reaches 9999, shooting will not be possible 
even if the card still has storage capacity. The LCD monitor will display a 
message telling you to replace the card. Replace it with a new card.

For both JPEG and RAW images, the file name will start with “IMG_”. Movie 
file names will start with “MVI_”. The extension will be “.JPG” for JPEG 
images, “.CR2” for RAW images, and “.MOV” or “.MP4” for movies.

Advanced Operations

In Creative Zone modes, you 
can change various settings of 
the camera as you desire to 
obtain a wide variety of 
shooting results, by selecting 
the shutter speed and/or 
aperture, adjusting the 
exposure as you prefer, etc.

 The O icon at the upper right of the page title indicates that 

the function is available only in Creative Zone modes (d/
s/f/a/F).

 After you press the shutter button halfway and let go, the 
exposure settings will remain displayed in the viewfinder 
and on the LCD panel for approx. 4 sec. (0) by the 
metering timer function.

 For the functions settable in each shooting mode, see page 

460.

Set the <R> switch downward.

189

d: Program AE
The camera automatically sets the shutter speed and aperture to suit 
the subject’s brightness. This is called Program AE.
* <d> stands for Program.
* AE stands for Auto Exposure.

1 Set the Mode Dial to <d>.

2 Focus on the subject.

 Look through the viewfinder and aim 
the AF point over the subject. Then 
press the shutter button halfway.

 When focus is achieved, the focus 
indicator <o> on the viewfinder’s 
bottom right will light up (when in 
One-Shot AF mode).

 The shutter speed and aperture will 

be set automatically and displayed in 
the viewfinder and on the LCD panel.

3 Check the display.

 The standard exposure will be 

obtained as long as the shutter speed 
and aperture display do not blink.

4 Take the picture.

 Compose the shot and press the 

shutter button completely.

190

d: Program AE

 If the “30"” shutter speed and the lowest f/number 

blink, it indicates underexposure.
Increase the ISO speed or use flash.

 If the “8000” shutter speed and the highest f/number 

blink, it indicates overexposure.
Lower the ISO speed or use an ND filter (sold 
separately) to reduce the amount of light entering the 
lens.

Differences Between <d> and <A> Modes
In the <A> mode, many functions, such as the AF operation and metering 
mode, are set automatically to prevent spoiled shots. The functions you can 
set are limited. With <d> mode, only the shutter speed and aperture are set 
automatically. You can freely set the AF operation, metering mode, and 
other functions (p.460).
Program Shift
 In the Program AE mode, you can freely change the shutter speed and 
aperture combination (Program) set automatically by the camera while 
maintaining the same exposure. This is called Program shift.

 To shift the program, press the shutter button halfway, then turn the 
<6> dial until the desired shutter speed or aperture is displayed.

 Program shift will be canceled automatically when the metering timer 

(0) ends (exposure setting display turns off).

 Program shift cannot be used with flash.

191

s: Shutter-Priority AE
In this mode, you set the shutter speed and the camera automatically 
sets the aperture to obtain the standard exposure matching the 
brightness of the subject. This is called shutter-priority AE. A faster 
shutter speed can freeze the action of a moving subject. A slower 
shutter speed can create a blurred effect, giving the impression of 
motion.
* <s> stands for Time value.

Blurred motion

(Slow shutter speed: 1/30 sec.)

Frozen motion

(Fast shutter speed: 1/2000 sec.)

1 Set the Mode Dial to <s>.

2 Set the desired shutter speed.

 While looking at the LCD panel, turn 

the <6> dial.

3 Focus on the subject.

 Press the shutter button halfway.
 The aperture is set automatically.

4 Check the viewfinder display and 

shoot.
 As long as the aperture is not 

blinking, the standard exposure will 
be obtained.

192

s: Shutter-Priority AE

 If the lowest f/number blinks, it indicates underexposure.
Turn the <6> dial to set a slower shutter speed until 
the aperture stops blinking or set a higher ISO speed.

 If the highest f/number blinks, it indicates overexposure.

Turn the <6> dial to set a faster shutter speed until 
the aperture stops blinking or set a lower ISO speed.

Shutter Speed Display
The shutter speeds from “8000” to “4” indicate the denominator of the 
fractional shutter speed. For example, “125” indicates 1/125 sec., “0"5” 
indicates 0.5 sec. and “15"” is 15 sec.

193

f: Aperture-Priority AE
In this mode, you set the desired aperture and the camera sets the 
shutter speed automatically to obtain the standard exposure matching 
the subject brightness. This is called aperture-priority AE. A higher 
f/number (smaller aperture hole) will make more of the foreground and 
background fall within acceptable focus. On the other hand, a lower 
f/number (larger aperture hole) will make less of the foreground and 
background fall within acceptable focus.
* <f> stands for Aperture value (aperture opening).

Blurred background

(With a low aperture f/number: f/5.6)

Sharp foreground and background
(With a high aperture f/number: f/32)

1 Set the Mode Dial to <f>.

2 Set the desired aperture.

 While looking at the LCD panel, turn 

the <6> dial.

3              Focus on the subject.

 Press the shutter button halfway.
 The shutter speed is set automatically.

4 Check the viewfinder display and 

shoot.
 As long as the shutter speed is not 
blinking, the standard exposure will 
be obtained.

194

f: Aperture-Priority AE

 If the “30"” shutter speed blinks, it indicates 

underexposure.
Turn the <6> dial to set a faster aperture 
(lower f/number) until the shutter speed blinking stops or 
set a higher ISO speed.

 If the “8000” shutter speed blinks, it indicates 

overexposure.
Turn the <6> dial to set a slower aperture (higher 
f/number) until the shutter speed blinking stops or set a 
lower ISO speed.

Aperture Value Display
The higher the f/number, the smaller the aperture opening will be. The 
f/number displayed will differ depending on the lens. If no lens is attached to 
the camera, “00” will be displayed for the aperture.

Depth-of-Field PreviewN
The aperture opening (diaphragm) changes only at the moment when 
the picture is taken. Otherwise, the aperture remains fully open. 
Therefore, when you look at the scene through the viewfinder or on the 
LCD monitor, the depth of field will look narrow.

Press the depth-of-field preview button 
to stop down the lens to the current 
aperture setting, and check the depth of 
field (range of acceptable focus).

 A higher f/number will make more of the foreground and background fall 

within acceptable focus. However, the viewfinder will look darker.

 The depth-of-field effect can be clearly seen on the Live View image as 

you change the aperture and press the depth-of-field preview button 
(p.256).

 The exposure will be locked (AE lock) while the depth-of-field preview 

button is being pressed.

195

a: Manual Exposure
In this mode, you set both the shutter speed and aperture as desired. To 
determine the exposure, refer to the exposure level indicator in the 
viewfinder or use a commercially-available exposure meter. This 
method is called manual exposure.
* <a> stands for Manual.

1 Set the Mode Dial to <a>.
2 Set the ISO speed (p.148).
3 Set the shutter speed and aperture.

 To set the shutter speed, turn the 

<6> dial.

 To set the aperture, turn the <5> dial.
 If it cannot be set, set the <R> 

switch downward, then turn the 
<6> or <5> dial.

4 Focus on the subject.

 Press the shutter button halfway.
 The exposure setting will be displayed 
in the viewfinder and on the LCD panel.
 Check the exposure level mark <h> 
to see how far the current exposure 
level is from the standard exposure 
level.

5 Set the exposure and take the 

picture.
 Check the exposure level indicator 

and set the desired shutter speed and 
aperture.

 If the exposure level exceeds ±3 

stops from the standard exposure, 
the end of the exposure level 
indicator will display <I> or <J>.

a: Manual Exposure

Exposure Compensation with ISO Auto
If the ISO speed is set to A (AUTO) for manual exposure shooting, you 
can set exposure compensation (p.200) as follows:

• [z2: Expo.comp./AEB]
• Under [8C.Fn III-4: Custom Controls] with [s: Expo comp 

(hold btn, turnS)] (p.438).

• Quick Control (p.56)

 If ISO Auto is set, the ISO speed setting will change to suit the shutter 
speed and aperture in order to obtain a standard exposure. Therefore, 
you may not obtain the desired exposure effect. In such a case, set the 
exposure compensation.

 If flash is used when ISO Auto is set, exposure compensation will not be 

applied even if an exposure compensation amount is set.

 Under [z2: Auto Lighting Optimizer], if the checkmark [X] for 

[Disabled in M or B modes] is removed, Auto Lighting Optimizer can be 
set even in the <a> mode (p.169).

 When ISO Auto is set, you can press the <A> button to lock the ISO 

speed.

 If you press the <A> button and recompose the shot, you can see the 
exposure level difference on the exposure level indicator compared with 
when the <A> button was pressed.

 If exposure compensation (p.200) was applied in <d>, <s>, or <f> 

mode, and then the shooting mode is switched to <a> with ISO Auto 
set, the exposure compensation amount already set will still be 
maintained.

 With ISO Auto set and [8C.Fn I-1: Exposure level increments] set to 

[1: 1/2-stop], 1/2-stop exposure compensation will be applied with the 
ISO speed (1/3 stop) and shutter speed. However, the shutter speed 
displayed will not change.

197

q Selecting the Metering ModeN
You can select one of four methods to measure the subject brightness. 
In Basic Zone modes, evaluative metering is set automatically. (In the 
<8: x> and <v: X> modes, center-weighted average metering is 
set.)

1 Press the <D> button (9).
2 Select the metering mode.

 While looking at the LCD panel, turn 

the <6> or <5> dial.
q:Evaluative metering
w:Partial metering
r:Spot metering
e:Center-weighted average 

metering

q Evaluative metering 

General-purpose metering mode suited even 
for backlit subjects. The camera adjusts the 
exposure automatically to suit the scene.

w Partial metering

Effective where there are much brighter lights 
around the subject due to backlight, etc. Partial 
metering covers approx. 6.0% of the viewfinder 
area at the center.

r Spot metering

Effective when metering a specific part of the 
subject or scene. Spot metering covers approx. 
3.8% of the viewfinder area at the center.

198

q Selecting the Metering ModeN

e Center-weighted average metering

The metering is averaged for the entire scene 
with the viewfinder center weighted more 
heavily.

With q (Evaluative metering), the exposure setting will be locked when you 
press the shutter button halfway and focus is achieved. In the w (Partial 
metering), r (Spot metering), and e (Center-weighted average metering) 
modes, the exposure is set at the moment the picture is taken. (Pressing the 
shutter button halfway does not lock the exposure.)

199

O Setting Exposure CompensationN
Exposure compensation can brighten (increased exposure) or darken 
(decreased exposure) the standard exposure set by the camera.
Exposure compensation can be set in the <d>, <s>, and <f> shooting 
modes. Although you can set the exposure compensation up to ±5 stops* in 
1/3-stop increments, the exposure compensation indicator in the viewfinder and 
on the LCD panel can only display the setting up to ±3 stops. If you want to set 
the exposure compensation setting beyond ±3 stops, use the Quick Control 
(p.56) or follow the instructions for [z2: Expo.comp./AEB] on the next page.
If the <a> mode and the ISO Auto are both set, see page 197 to set the 
exposure compensation.
* During Live View shooting, exposure compensation can be set up to ±3 stops. 

Increased exposure 
for a brighter image

Decreased exposure 
for a darker image

1 Check the exposure.

 Press the shutter button halfway 

(0) and check the exposure level 
indicator.

2 Set the exposure compensation amount.

 While looking in the viewfinder or at 

the LCD panel, turn the <5> dial.

 If it cannot be set, set the <R> 

switch downward, then turn the <5> 
dial.

 If you set exposure compensation, 

<O> will be displayed in the 
viewfinder and on the LCD panel.

3 Take the picture.

 To cancel the exposure compensation, set 
the exposure compensation amount back 
to <E>.

If [z2: Auto Lighting Optimizer] (p.169) is set to any setting other than 
[Disable], the image may still look bright even if a decreased exposure 
compensation for a darker image is set.

 The exposure compensation amount will remain in effect even after you 

set the power switch to <2>.

 After setting the exposure compensation amount, you can prevent the 
exposure compensation amount from changing accidentally by setting 
the <R> switch upward.

 If the exposure compensation amount exceeds ±3 stops, the end of the 

exposure level indicator will display <I> or <J>.

200

Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB)N
By changing the shutter speed or aperture automatically, the camera 
brackets the exposure up to ±3 stops in 1/3-stop increments for three 
successive shots. This is called AEB.
* AEB stands for Auto Exposure Bracketing.

1 Select [Expo.comp./AEB].
 Under the [z2] tab, select 

[Expo.comp./AEB], then press 
<0>.

2 Set the AEB range.

 Turn the <6> dial to set the AEB

Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB)N

 During AEB, <A> in the viewfinder and AEB range will blink.
 If the drive mode is set to <u> or <B>, press the shutter button three 
times for each shot. When <o>, <i>, or <M> is set and you hold 
down the shutter button completely, the three bracketed shots will be 
taken continuously and the camera will automatically stop shooting. 
When <Q> or <k> is set, the three bracketed shots will be taken 
continuously after a 10-sec. or 2-sec. delay.

 You can set AEB in combination with exposure compensation.
 If the AEB range exceeds ±3 stops, the end of the exposure level 

indicator will display <I> or <J>.

 AEB cannot be used with flash, bulb exposures, or when [Multi Shot 

Noise Reduction], [HDR Mode], or a Creative filter is set.

 AEB will be canceled automatically when you set the power switch to 

<2> or when the flash is ready to fire.

202

A AE LockN
You can lock the exposure when the area of focus is to be different from 
the exposure metering area or when you want to take multiple shots at 
the same exposure setting. Press the <A> button to lock the exposure, 
then recompose and take the picture. This is called AE lock. It is 
effective for shooting backlit subjects, etc.

1 Focus on the subject.

F: Bulb Exposures
In this mode, the shutter stays open as long as you hold down the 
shutter button completely, and closes when you let go of the shutter 
button. This is called bulb exposure. Use bulb exposures for night 
scenes, fireworks, the heavens, and other subjects requiring long 
exposures.

1 Set the Mode Dial to <F>.

2 Set the desired aperture.

 While looking at the LCD panel, turn 

the <6> or <5> dial.

3 Take the picture.

 The exposure will continue for as long 

as you keep the shutter button 
pressed completely.

 The elapsed exposure time will be 

displayed on the LCD panel.

Elapsed exposure time

 Do not point the camera toward an intense light source, such as the sun 

or an intense artificial light source. Doing so may damage the image 
sensor or the camera’s internal components.

 Long exposures produce more noise than usual.
 If ISO Auto is set, the ISO speed will be ISO 400 (p.150).
 For a bulb exposure, if you use both the self-timer and mirror lockup 
instead of the bulb timer, keep pressing the shutter button completely 
(self-timer delay time + bulb exposure time). If you let go of the shutter 
button during the self-timer countdown, there will be a shutter-release 
sound, but no picture will be taken. If you use the bulb timer under the 
same shooting conditions, you need not keep holding down the shutter 
button completely.

204

F: Bulb Exposures

 With [z3: Long exp. noise reduction], you can reduce the noise 

generated during long exposures (p.172).

 For bulb exposures, using a tripod and bulb timer is recommended. 

Using mirror lockup (p.219) with bulb exposures is also possible.

 You can also shoot bulb exposures by using Remote Switch RS-60E3 

(sold separately, p.221).

 You can also use Remote Controller RC-6 (sold separately, p.221) for 

bulb exposures. When you press the remote controller’s transmit button, 
the bulb exposure will start immediately or 2 sec. later. Press the button 
again to stop the bulb exposure.

p Bulb TimerN
You can preset the bulb exposure’s exposure time. With the bulb timer, 
you need not keep holding down the shutter button during the bulb 
exposure. This reduces camera vibration blur.
The bulb timer can be set only in the <F> (Bulb) shooting mode. It 
cannot be set (or will not function) in any other shooting mode.

1 Select [Bulb timer].

 Under the [z4] tab, select [Bulb

[Disable]): Set the power switch to <2>, switch to movie shooting, or 
change to a shooting mode other than <F>.

206

w: HDR (High Dynamic Range) ShootingN
Clipped highlights and shadows will be reduced for a high dynamic 
range of tones even with high-contrast scenes. HDR shooting is 
effective for landscape and still-life shots.
With HDR shooting, three images of different exposures (standard 
exposure, underexposure, and overexposure) are captured 
continuously for each shot and then merged together 
automatically. The HDR image is recorded as a JPEG image.
* HDR stands for High Dynamic Range.

1 Select [HDR Mode].

For images preserving a wide tonal range where the highlight and 
shadow details would otherwise be lost. Clipped highlights and 
shadows will be reduced.

 Art standard

While the clipped highlights and shadows will be reduced more than 
with [Natural], the contrast will be lower, and the gradation flatter to 
have the picture look like a painting. The subject outlines will have 
bright (or dark) edges.

 Art vivid

The colors are more saturated than with [Art standard], and the low 
contrast and flat gradation create a graphic art effect.

 Art bold

The colors are the most saturated, making the subject pop out, and 
the picture look like an oil painting.

 Art embossed

The color saturation, brightness, contrast and gradation are 
decreased to make the picture look flat. The picture looks faded and 
old. The subject outlines will have bolder bright (or dark) edges.

you cannot merge multiple images already recorded on the card.

 Are multiple exposures possible with Live View shooting?

You can shoot multiple exposures with Live View shooting (p.255).

 Will auto power off take effect during multiple-exposure 

shooting?
As long as [52: Auto power off] is set to any setting other than 
[Disable], the timing for auto power off to automatically take effect 
will all become after approx. 30 min. of idle time. If the auto power off 
takes effect, multiple-exposure shooting will end, and multiple-
exposure settings will be canceled.
Before starting the multiple-exposure shooting, the auto power off 
will take effect at the time set with the camera, and multiple-
exposure settings will be canceled.

218

2 Mirror LockupN
Camera vibrations caused by the mirror’s reflex action when the picture 
is taken is called “mirror shock”. Mirror lockup keeps the mirror up 
before and during exposure to reduce blur caused by camera 
vibrations. Useful when shooting close-ups (macro photography), using 
a super telephoto lens, and shooting at slow shutter speeds.

1 Set [Mirror lockup] to [Enable].
 Under the [z4] tab, select [Mirror 

lockup], then press <0>.

 Select [Enable], then press <0>.

2 Focus on the subject, then press 

the shutter button completely.
 The mirror will swing up.

3 Press the shutter button 

completely again.
 The picture is taken and the mirror 

goes back down.

 Do not point the camera toward an intense light source, such as the sun or an 
intense artificial light source. Doing so may damage the image sensor or the 
camera’s internal components.

 In very bright light, such as at the beach or a ski slope on a sunny day, take 

the picture promptly after mirror lockup is stabilized.

 If you use the self-timer and bulb exposure in combination with a mirror 

lockup, keep pressing the shutter button completely (self-timer delay time + 
bulb exposure time). If you let go of the shutter button during the self-timer 
countdown, there will be a shutter-release sound, but no picture will be taken.
 During mirror lockup, shooting function settings and menu operations, etc. are 

disabled.

219

Using the Eyepiece Cover

 Even if the drive mode is set to continuous shooting, only one shot can 

be taken.

 You can also use the self-timer with mirror lockup.
 If approx. 30 sec. elapse after the mirror is locked up, it will go back down 
automatically. Pressing the shutter button completely again locks up the 
mirror again.

 When shooting with mirror lockup, using a tripod and Remote Switch 

RS-60E3 (sold separately, p.221) is recommended.

 You can also use a remote controller (sold separately, p.221) with mirror 
lockup. Setting the remote controller to a 2-sec. delay is recommended.

Using the Eyepiece Cover
When you take a picture without looking through the viewfinder, such as 
when you use the self-timer, bulb exposure, or a remote switch, stray 
light entering the viewfinder can cause the picture to look dark. To 
prevent this, use the eyepiece cover (p.33) attached to the camera 
strap.
During Live View shooting and movie shooting, attaching the eyepiece 
cover is unnecessary.

 1 Detach the eyecup.

 Push the bottom of the eyecup to 

detach it.

2 Attach the eyepiece cover.

 Slide the eyepiece cover down into 

the eyepiece groove to attach it.

 After you finish shooting, detach the 

eyepiece cover and attach the 
eyecup.

220

F Using a Remote Switch
You can connect Remote Switch RS-60E3 (sold separately) to the 
camera and shoot (p.468).
For detailed instructions, refer to the remote switch’s instruction 
manual.

1 Open the terminal cover.
2 Connect the plug to the remote 

control terminal.

R Remote Control Shooting

With Remote Controller RC-6 (sold separately), you 
can shoot remotely up to approx. 5 meters/16.4 feet 
away from the camera. You can either shoot 
immediately or with a 2-sec. delay.
You can also use Remote Controller RC-1 and RC-5 
(sold separately).

 Fluorescent or LED lighting may cause camera misoperation by 

triggering the shutter inadvertently. Try to keep the camera away from 
such light sources.

 If you point a remote controller for a TV set toward the camera and 

operate it, it may cause camera misoperation by triggering the shutter 
inadvertently.

 If flash light is emitted from a flash on another camera around this 

camera, it may cause camera misoperation by triggering the shutter 
inadvertently. Do not expose the remote control sensor to flash light from 
a flash on another camera.

Remote control shooting is also possible with an EX-series Speedlite 
equipped with a remote-release function.

222

p Interval Timer Shooting
With the interval timer, you can set the shooting interval and the number 
of shots. The camera will take a series of single shots at the set interval 
until the set number of shots are taken.

 Using a tripod is recommended.
 Taking test shots is recommended.
 After the interval timer shooting starts, you can still press the shutter 

button completely to take a picture as usual. However, from 5 sec. before 
the next interval timer shooting, the shooting function settings, menu 
operation, image playback, and other operations will be suspended and 
the camera will return to shooting-ready state.

 If a picture is being taken or an image is being processed when the next 

shot is scheduled on the interval timer, the shot set for that time will be 
skipped. The camera will thereby shoot fewer shots than the number set 
for interval timer shooting.

 Auto power off operates with the interval timer. The power will 

automatically turn on approx. 1 min. before the next shot.

 Interval timer shooting can be combined with AEB, WB bracketing, 

multiple exposures, and HDR mode.

 You can stop the interval timer shooting by selecting [Disable] or turning 

the power switch to <2>.

224

p Interval Timer Shooting

 Do not point the camera toward an intense light source, such as the sun 

or an intense artificial light source. Doing so may damage the image 
sensor or the camera’s internal components.

 If the lens’s focus mode switch is set to <AF>, the camera will not shoot 
when focus is not achieved. Setting it to <MF> and focusing manually is 
recommended.

 Live View shooting, movie shooting, or bulb exposures cannot be 

performed with interval timer.

 If the shooting time is long, using DC Coupler DR-E6 (sold separately) 

and AC Adapter AC-E6N (sold separately) is recommended.

 If a shutter speed longer than the shooting interval is set, such as a long 
exposure, the camera cannot shoot with the set interval. The camera will 
thereby shoot fewer shots than the number set for interval timer 
shooting. Also, the number of shots may decrease when the shutter 
speed and the shooting interval are nearly the same.

 If the image recording time on the card is longer than the set shooting 
interval due to card performance or shooting settings, etc., the camera 
may not shoot with the set shooting interval.

 If you use flash with interval timer shooting, set an interval longer than 
the flash’s recycling time. If the interval is too short, the flash may not 
fire.

 If the shooting interval is too short, the camera may not take a picture or 

may capture an image without autofocusing.

 Interval timer shooting will be canceled and reset to [Disable] if you do 
any of the following: Set the power switch to <2>, display the Live 
View or movie shooting screen, set the shooting mode to <F> or <w/
x>, or use EOS Utility (EOS software, p.512).

 After interval timer shooting starts, you cannot use remote control 

shooting (p.221) or remote-release shooting with an EOS-dedicated, 
external Speedlite.

 If your eye will not remain on the viewfinder eyepiece during interval 

timer shooting, attach the eyepiece cover (p.220). If stray light enters the 
viewfinder when the picture is taken, it may throw off the exposure.

D Using the Built-in Flash

In Creative Zone modes, just press the 
<D> button to raise the built-in flash for 
flash photography.
Before shooting, check that [D] is 
displayed in the viewfinder. After shooting, 
push the built-in flash back down with your 
fingers until it clicks into place.

In Basic Zone modes, depending on the shooting mode, you can set the 
built-in flash with Quick Control (p.107).
The table below shows the shutter speed and aperture settings that will

Flash Photography in the <f> Mode
To obtain a correct flash exposure, the flash output will be set automatically 
(autoflash exposure) to match the manually-set aperture. The shutter speed 
will be set automatically between 1/250 sec. - 30 sec. to suit the scene’s 
brightness.
In low light, the main subject is exposed with the auto flash metering, and 
the background is exposed with a slow shutter speed set automatically. Both 
the subject and background look properly exposed with a touch of 
atmosphere (automatic slow-speed flash sync). If you are handholding the 
camera, keep it steady to prevent camera shake. Using a tripod is 
recommended.
To prevent a slow shutter speed, under [z1: Flash control], set [Flash 
sync. speed in Av mode] to [1/250-1/60sec. auto] or [1/250 sec. (fixed)] 
(p.236).

233

D Using an External Speedlite

Canon Speedlites Other Than the EX-series
 With an EZ/E/EG/ML/TL-series Speedlite set to A-TTL or TTL 

autoflash mode, the flash can be fired at full output only.
Set the camera’s shooting mode to <a> (manual exposure) or 
<f> (aperture-priority AE) and adjust the aperture setting before 
shooting.

 When using a Speedlite that has manual flash mode, shoot in the 

manual flash mode.

Non-Canon Flash Units
Sync Speed
The camera can synchronize with non-Canon compact flash units at 
1/250 sec. and slower speeds. With large studio flash units, be sure to 
test the flash synchronization before shooting with the sync speed set 
within approx. 1/60 sec. to 1/30 sec. The flash duration of such units is 
longer than that of compact flash units and varies depending on the 
model.

Cautions for Live View Shooting
If you use a non-Canon flash unit with Live View shooting, set [z6: 
Silent LV shoot.] to [Disable] (p.272). The flash will not fire if it is set to 
[Mode 1] or [Mode 2].

 If the camera is used with a flash unit or flash accessory dedicated to 

another camera brand, the camera may not operate properly and 
malfunction may result.

 Do not attach a high-voltage flash unit on the camera’s hot shoe. It may 

not fire.

234

3 Setting the FlashN
With the built-in flash or an EX-series, external Speedlite compatible 
with flash function settings, you can use the camera’s menu screen to 
set flash functions and the external Speedlite’s Custom Functions. If 
you use an external Speedlite, attach the Speedlite to the camera 
and turn on the Speedlite before setting the flash functions.
For details on the external Speedlite’s flash functions, refer to the 
Speedlite’s instruction manual.

1 Select [Flash control].

 Under the [z1] tab, select [Flash 

control], then press <0>.

 The Flash control screen will appear.

2 Select the desired item.

 Select the menu option to be set, then

Flash Firing

E-TTL II Metering

To enable flash photography, set 
[Enable]. To enable only the AF-assist 
beam to be emitted, set [Disable].

For normal flash exposures, set it to 
[Evaluative]. If [Average] is set, the 
flash exposure will be averaged for the 
entire metered scene. Depending on the 
scene, flash exposure compensation 
may be necessary. This setting is for 
advanced users.

235

3 Setting the FlashN

Flash Synchronization Speed in Av Mode

You can set the flash-sync speed for 
flash photography in the aperture-priority 
AE <f> mode.

 4: Auto

The flash sync speed is set automatically within a range of 1/250 
sec. to 30 sec. to suit the scene’s brightness. High-speed sync is 
also possible.

 6: 1/250-1/60 sec. auto

Prevents a slow shutter speed from being set in low-light conditions. 
It is effective for preventing subject blur and camera shake. 
However, while the subject will be properly exposed with the flash, 
the background may come out dark.

 7: 1/250 sec. (fixed)

The flash-sync speed is fixed at 1/250 sec. This more effectively 
prevents subject blur and camera shake than with [1/250-1/60sec. 
auto]. However, in low light, the subject’s background will come out 
darker than with [1/250-1/60sec. auto].

If [1/250-1/60sec. auto] or [1/250 sec. (fixed)] is set, high-speed sync is not 
possible in the <f> mode with the external Speedlite.

the flash fires immediately after the 
exposure starts.

If [2nd curtain] is set, the flash will fire right before the shutter closes. 
When this is combined with a slow shutter speed, you can create a trail 
of light such as from car headlights at night with a more natural feel. 
When second-curtain synchronization is set together with [E-TTL II], the 
flash will be fired twice in a row: once when you press the shutter button 
completely and once right before the end of the exposure.

When using second-curtain synchronization, set the shutter speed to 1/25 
sec. or slower. If the shutter speed is 1/30 sec. or faster, first-curtain 
synchronization will be applied automatically even if [2nd curtain] is set.

3 Setting the FlashN

Wireless (multiple) flash shooting is 
possible with radio or optical 
transmission.
For details on wireless flash, refer to the 
instruction manual of a Speedlite 
compatible with wireless flash shooting.
With a macro flash (MR-14EX II, etc.) 
compatible with flash function settings, 
you can set the flash ratio between flash 
tubes or flash heads A and B, or perform 
wireless flash with additional slave units.
For details on flash ratio control, refer to 
the macro flash’s instruction manual.

 Flash zoom (Flash coverage)

 Shutter synchronization

With Speedlites having a zooming flash 
head, you can set the flash coverage. 
Normally, set this to [AUTO] so that the 
camera will automatically set the flash 
coverage to match the lens focal length.

Normally, set this to [First-curtain 
synchronization] so that the flash fires 
immediately after the exposure starts.

If [Second-curtain synchronization] is set, the flash will fire right before 
the shutter closes. When this is combined with a slow shutter speed, you 
can create a trail of light such as from car headlights at night with a more 
natural feel. When second-curtain synchronization is set together with [E-
TTL II], the flash will be fired twice in a row: once when you press the 
shutter button completely and once right before the end of the exposure.
If [High-speed synchronization] is set, the flash can be used at all 
shutter speeds. This is useful when you want to shoot with background 
blur (open aperture) in locations such as outdoors in daylight.

241

3 Setting the FlashN

 Flash exposure compensation

The same setting as step 3 in “Flash 
Exposure Compensation” on page 230 
can be set.

instruction manual.

 Flash exposure bracketing

While the flash output is changed 
automatically, three shots are taken.
For details, refer to the instruction 
manual of a Speedlite compatible with 
flash exposure bracketing.

When using second-curtain synchronization, set the shutter speed to 1/25 
sec. or slower. If the shutter speed is 1/30 sec. or faster, first-curtain 
synchronization will be applied automatically even if [Second-curtain 
synchronization] is set.

 With an EX-series Speedlite not compatible with flash function settings, 

you can only set the following: [Flash firing], [E-TTL II meter.], and 
[Flash exposure compensation] under [External flash func. setting]. 
([Shutter synchronization] can also be set with certain EX-series 
Speedlites.)

 If flash exposure compensation is set with an external Speedlite, you 
cannot set the flash exposure compensation with the camera (Quick 
Control or External flash function settings). If it is set with both the 
camera and external Speedlite, the Speedlite’s setting overrides the 
camera’s.

and-white effect by adjusting the contrast.

 W Soft focus

Gives the image a soft look. You can change the degree of softness 
by adjusting the blur.

 X Fish-eye effect

Gives the effect of a fish-eye lens. The image will have a barrel-type 
distortion.
Depending on the level of this filter effect, the area trimmed along 
the periphery of the image changes. Also, since this filter expands 
the center part of the image, the resolution at the center may 
decrease depending on the number of recorded pixels. Check the 
image on the screen when setting this filter. The AF method will be 
FlexiZone - Single (fixed at center).

Makes the photo look like an oil painting and the subject look more 
three-dimensional. You can adjust the contrast and saturation. Note 
that subjects such as the sky or white walls may not be rendered 
with a smooth gradation and may look irregular or noise will become 
more noticeable.

 Z Water painting effect

Makes the photo look like a watercolor painting with soft colors. You 
can control the color density by adjusting the filter effect. Note that 
some scenes including night scenes or low-light scenes may not be 
rendered with a smooth gradation and may look irregular or  noise 
will become more noticeable.

General Live View Shooting Cautions
Image Quality
 When you shoot at high ISO speeds, noise (such as dots of light and 

banding) may become noticeable.

 Shooting in high temperatures may cause noise and irregular colors in 

the image.

 If Live View shooting is used continuously for a prolonged period, the 

camera’s internal temperature may rise, and image quality may 
deteriorate. Always exit Live View shooting when you are not shooting.
 If you shoot a long exposure while the camera’s internal temperature is 
high, image quality may deteriorate. Exit Live View shooting and wait a 
few minutes before shooting again.

White <s> and Red <E> Internal Temperature Warning Icons
 If the camera’s internal temperature increases due to prolonged Live 

View shooting or under a high ambient temperature, a white <s> or red 
<E> icon will appear.

 The white <s> icon indicates that the image quality of still photos will 

deteriorate. It is recommended that you temporarily exit Live View 
shooting and allow the camera to cool down before shooting again.

 The red <E> icon indicates that the Live View shooting will soon stop 

automatically. If this happens, you will not be able to shoot again until the 
camera’s internal temperature decreases. Exit the Live View shooting or 
turn off the power and let the camera rest for a while.

 Using Live View shooting at a high temperature for a prolonged period 
will cause the <s> or <E> icon to appear earlier. When you are not 
shooting, always turn off the camera.

 If the camera’s internal temperature is high, the quality of images shot 
with high ISO speed or long exposure may deteriorate even before the 
white <s> icon is displayed.

Shooting Results
 In magnified view, the shutter speed and aperture will be displayed in 

red. If you take the picture in magnified view, the exposure may not come 
out as desired. Return to the normal view before taking the picture.

 Even if you take the picture in magnified view, the image area for the 

normal view will be captured.

290

General Live View Shooting Cautions
Live View Image
 Under low- or bright-light conditions, the Live View image may not reflect 

the brightness of the captured image.

 Even if a low ISO speed is set, noise may be noticeable in the displayed 

Live View image under low light. However, when you shoot, the image 
recorded will have less noise. (The image quality of the Live View image 
is different from that of the recorded image.)

 If the light source (illumination) within the image changes, the screen 
may flicker. If this happens, exit Live View shooting and resume Live 
View shooting under the actual light source.

 If you point the camera in a different direction, it may throw off the Live 
View image’s correct brightness momentarily. Wait until the brightness 
level stabilizes before shooting.

 If there is a very bright light source in the image, the bright area may 

appear black on the LCD monitor. However, the actual captured image 
will correctly show the bright area.

 In low light, if you set the [52: LCD brightness] to a bright setting, noise 

or irregular colors may appear in the Live View image. However, the 
noise or irregular colors will not be recorded in the captured image.
 When you magnify the image, the image sharpness may look more 

pronounced than in the actual image.

Custom Functions
 During Live View shooting, certain Custom Function settings will not take 

effect (p.411).

Lens and Flash
 If the attached lens has an Image Stabilizer and you set the Image 

Stabilizer (IS) switch to <1>, the Image Stabilizer will operate at all 
times even if you do not press the shutter button halfway. The Image 
Stabilizer consumes battery power and may decrease the number of 
possible shots depending on the shooting conditions. When the Image 
Stabilizer is not necessary, such as when using a tripod, it is 
recommended to set the IS switch to <2>.

 The focus preset function is possible for Live View shooting only when 

using a (super) telephoto lens equipped with the focus preset mode 
released in and after the second half of 2011.

 FE lock will not work if the built-in flash is used. FE lock and modeling 

flash will not work if an external Speedlite is used.

 When switching from still photo shooting to movie shooting, check the 

ISO speed settings before shooting movies.

 Changing the shutter speed or aperture during movie shooting is not 

recommended since the changes in the exposure will be recorded.
 When shooting a movie of a moving subject, a shutter speed within 

approx. 1/30 sec. to 1/125 sec. is recommended. The faster the shutter

Cautions for Movie Shooting
 Do not point the camera toward an intense light source, such as the sun 

or an intense artificial light source. Doing so may damage the image 
sensor or the camera’s internal components.

 When you press the shutter button halfway to autofocus during movie 

shooting, the following phenomena may occur.
• Focus may become far off momentarily.
• The brightness of the recorded movie may change.
• The recorded movie may be momentarily still.
• The movie may record the lens mechanical sound.

 If <Q> or <Qw> is set and the ISO speed or aperture changes during 

movie shooting, the white balance may also change.

 If you shoot a movie under fluorescent or LED lighting, the movie may 

flicker.

 Shooting a few test movies is recommended where you will perform 
zooming during movie shooting. Zooming during movie shooting may 
result in recording of changes in exposure or mechanical sound of the 
lens, or images may be out of focus.

 During movie shooting, you cannot magnify the image even if you press 

the <u> button.

 Be careful not to cover the built-in microphones (p.294) with your finger, etc.
 If you connect or disconnect the HDMI cable during movie shooting, the 

movie shooting will end.

 General Movie Shooting Cautions are on pages 343-344.
 If necessary, also read General Live View Shooting Cautions on 

pages 290-291.

Do not hold the camera in the same position for long periods of time.
Even if the camera does not feel too hot, prolonged contact with the same 
body part may cause skin redness or blistering due to low-temperature 
contact burns. Using a tripod is recommended for people with circulation 
problems or very sensitive skin, or when using the camera in very hot 
places.

 The movie image’s field of view is approx. 100% (with movie recording 

size set to [1920x1080]).

 You can also focus on the image by pressing the <p> button.
 Stereo sound is recorded by the camera’s built-in microphones.
 Stereo sound recording is also possible by connecting the Directional 
Stereo Microphone DM-E1 (sold separately) to the camera’s external 
microphone IN terminal (p.26) as the external microphone is given the 
priority.

 With a fully-charged Battery Pack LP-E6N, the total movie shooting time 

will be as follows: approx. 1 hr. 50 min. at room temperature (23°C /

3 Setting the Sound Recording

You can shoot movies while recording 
sound with the built-in stereo 
microphones or the Directional Stereo 
Microphone DM-E1 (sold separately). 
You can also freely adjust the sound-
recording level.
Set the sound recording with [z4: 
Sound recording].

Sound Recording/Sound-Recording Level
[Auto]

: The sound-recording level is adjusted automatically. Auto 
level control will operate automatically in response to the 
sound level.

[Manual] : For advanced users. You can adjust the sound-recording 

level to one of 64 levels.
Select [Rec. level] and turn the <5> dial while looking at 
the level meter to adjust the sound-recording level. Look at 
the peak hold indicator, and adjust so that the level meter 
sometimes lights up on the right of the “12” (-12 dB) mark 
for the loudest sounds. If it exceeds “0”, the sound will be 
distorted.

[Disable] : Sound will not be recorded.

Wind Filter/Attenuator
[Wind filter] : When set to [Auto], it reduces wind noise when there is 

wind outdoors. This feature takes effect only with the 
built-in microphones. When the wind filter function takes 
effect, low bass sounds will also be reduced.

[Attenuator]: Automatically suppresses sound distortion caused by 

loud noises. Even if you set [Sound recording] to [Auto] 
or [Manual] before shooting, sound distortion may still 
result if there is a very loud sound. In such a case, setting 
it to [Enable] is recommended.

312

3 Setting the Sound Recording

 Using Microphones

Normally, the built-in microphones will record stereo sound.
Stereo sound recording is also possible by connecting the 
Directional Stereo Microphone DM-E1 (sold separately) to the 
camera’s external microphone IN terminal (p.26) as the external 
microphone is given the priority.

 Using Headphones

By connecting stereo headphones (commercially-available) 
equipped with a 3.5 mm diameter mini plug to the camera’s 
headphone terminal (p.26), you can listen to the sound during movie 
shooting. To adjust the headphones’ sound volume, press the <Q> 
button and select <y>. Then turn <5> to adjust (p.305).
You can also use headphones during movie playback.

 When using headphones for audio, noise reduction will not be applied to 
the headphone output. Because of this, what you hear will differ from the 
actual audio recorded with the movie.

 An external microphone may pick up noise while wireless functions are in 

use. Keep a distance between the camera and microphone.

 In Basic Zone modes, the settings available for [z2: Sound recording] 
will be [On/Off]. If [On] is set, the sound-recording level will be adjusted 
automatically (same as with [Auto]), and the wind filter function will take 
effect.

 The sound volume balance between L (left) and R (right) cannot be 

adjusted.

 Audio is recorded at a 48 kHz/16-bit sampling rate.

Shooting HDR Movies

 Since multiple frames are merged to create an HDR movie, a part of the 
movie may be distorted. During shooting while handholding the camera, 
the distortion caused by camera shake may be more noticeable. Using a 
tripod is recommended. Note that even if a tripod is used for shooting, 
afterimages may be noticeable or noise may look increased when the 
HDR movie is played back frame-by-frame or in slow-motion compared 
to normal playback.

 HDR movie shooting cannot be set if movie digital zoom, video snapshot, 

or time-lapse movie is set.

With this function enabled, the camera focuses on the subject 
continuously during movie shooting. The default setting is [Enable].
When [Enable] is set:
• The camera focuses on the subject continuously even when you 

are not pressing the shutter button halfway.

• If you want to keep the focus at a specific point, or if you do not 

want the lens mechanical sound to be recorded, you can 
temporarily stop Movie Servo AF as follows. When you stop Movie

Cautions When [Movie Servo AF] is Set to [Enable]
 Shooting Conditions that Make Focusing Difficult

• A fast-moving subject approaching or moving away from the camera.
• A subject moving at a close distance in front of the camera.
• Also see “Shooting Conditions that Make Focusing Difficult” on page 

284.

 Since this drives the lens continuously, it will consume battery power and 

shorten the total possible movie shooting time (p.309).

 With certain lenses, the lens mechanical sound during focusing may be 
recorded. If this happens, use the Directional Stereo Microphone DM-E1 
(sold separately) to reduce the lens mechanical sound in the movie. Also, 
using certain USM lenses (for example, the EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS 
USM) or certain STM lenses (for example, the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS 
STM) will reduce the lens mechanical sound to be recorded.

 Movie Servo AF will pause during zooming or in magnified view.
 During movie shooting, if a subject approaches or moves away or if the 
camera is moved vertically or horizontally (panning), the recorded movie 
image may momentarily expand or contract (change in image 
magnification).

 If you want to set the lens’s focus mode switch to <MF> during Movie 

Servo AF, first set the Live View shooting/Movie shooting switch to

You can set the Movie Servo AF’s AF 
speed and its operation conditions.
This function is settable when [Movie 
Servo AF] is set to [Enable] and [AF 
method] is set to [FlexiZone - Single]. 
Additionally, the function is enabled 
when using a lens supporting slow focus 
transition during movie shooting*.

When active : [Always on] sets the AF adjustment speed to take effect 
at all times for movie shooting (before and during movie 
shooting). [During shooting] sets the AF adjustment 
speed to take effect only during movie shooting.

AF speed

: You can adjust the AF speed (focus transition speed) 
from standard speed to slow (one of seven levels) or 
fast (one of two levels), to obtain the desired effect for 
movie creation.

* Lenses supporting slow focus transition during movie shooting
USM lenses released in and after 2009 (for example, the EF-S 18-
135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM) and STM lenses (for example, the EF-S 18-
55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM) support slow focus transition during movie 
shooting. For details, refer to the Canon Web site.

If [AF method] is set to [u+Tracking] or [FlexiZone - Multi], the operation 
will be the same as when [AF speed] is set to [Standard (0)].

 Movie Servo AF tracking sensitivityO

You can change the Movie Servo AF’s 
tracking sensitivity to one of seven 
levels. This affects the responsiveness of 
AF tracking sensitivity when the AF 
points stray from the subject, such as 
during panning or when an obstacle cuts 
across the AF points.
This function is settable when [Movie 
Servo AF] is set to [Enable] and [AF 
method] is set to [FlexiZone - Single].

Locked on: -3/-2/-1
This setting makes the camera less inclined to track a different subject if 
the AF point loses the original subject. The closer the setting is to the 
minus (-) symbol, the less the camera is inclined to track a different 
subject. It is effective when you want to prevent the AF points from 
rapidly tracking something that is not the intended subject during 
panning or when an obstacle cuts across the AF points.

Responsive: +1/+2/+3
This makes the camera more responsive when tracking a subject that 
covers the AF point. The closer the setting is to the plus (+) symbol, the 
more responsive the camera is. It is effective when you want to keep 
tracking a moving subject as its distance from the camera changes, or 
to rapidly focus on another subject.

If [AF method] is set to [u+Tracking] or [FlexiZone - Multi], the tracking 
sensitivity will be equivalent to the [0] setting.

Cautions for Shooting Video Snapshots 
 When the MOV format is selected, video snapshot cannot be set.
 You can add to an album only video snapshots with the same duration 

(approx. 2 sec., 4 sec., or 8 sec. each).

 Note that if you do any of the following while shooting video snapshots, a 

new album will be created for subsequent video snapshots.
• Changing the [Movie rec. size].
• Changing the [Sound rec.] setting from [Auto]/[Manual] to [Disable] 

or from [Disable] to [Auto]/[Manual].

• Updating the firmware.

 The shooting duration of a video snapshot is only approximate. 

Depending on the frame rate, the shooting duration displayed during 
playback may not be exact.

General Movie Shooting Cautions
Red <E> Internal Temperature Warning Icon
 If the camera’s internal temperature increases due to prolonged movie 

shooting or under a high ambient temperature, a red <E> icon will 
appear.

 The red <E> icon indicates that movie shooting will soon be terminated 
automatically. If this happens, you will not be able to shoot again until the 
camera’s internal temperature decreases. Turn off the power and let the 
camera rest for a while.

 Shooting a movie at a high temperature for a prolonged period will cause 
the <E> icon to appear earlier. When you are not shooting, always turn 
off the camera.

Recording and Image Quality
 If the attached lens has an Image Stabilizer and you set the Image 

Stabilizer (IS) switch to <1>, the Image Stabilizer will operate at all 
times even if you do not press the shutter button halfway. The Image 
Stabilizer consumes battery power and may shorten the total movie 
shooting time depending on the shooting conditions. If you use a tripod 
or if the Image Stabilizer is not necessary, it is recommended to set the 
IS switch to <2>.

 The camera’s built-in microphones will also pick up the operation sound 

during shooting and mechanical sound of the camera. Use the 
Directional Stereo Microphone DM-E1 (sold separately) to reduce these 
sounds in the movie.

 Do not connect anything other than an external microphone to the 

camera’s external microphone IN terminal.

 If the brightness changes during autoexposure movie shooting, the 

movie may freeze temporarily. In such a case, shoot movies with manual 
exposure.

 If there is a very bright light source in the image, the bright area may 
appear black on the LCD monitor. The movie will be recorded almost 
exactly as it appears on the LCD monitor.

 In low light, noise or irregular colors may appear in the image. The movie 

will be recorded almost exactly as it appears on the LCD monitor.

 If you play back a movie with other devices, image or sound quality may 
deteriorate or playback may not be possible (even if the devices support 
MOV/MP4 format).

343

General Movie Shooting Cautions
Recording and Image Quality
 If you use a card with a slow writing speed, a five-level 

indicator may appear on the right of the screen during movie 
shooting. It indicates how much data has not yet been 
written to the card (remaining capacity of the internal buffer 
memory). The slower the card, the faster the indicator will 
climb upward. If the indicator becomes full, movie shooting 
will stop automatically.
If the card has a fast writing speed, the indicator will either 
not appear or the level (if displayed) will hardly go upward. 
First, shoot a few test movies to see if the card can write fast enough.

Indicator

Playback and TV Connection
 If you connect the camera to a TV set (p.373) and shoot a movie, the TV 

set will not output any sound during the shooting. However, the sound 
will be properly recorded.

Restrictions on MP4-format Movies
Note that generally the following restrictions apply to MP4-format movies.
 Sound will not be recorded on approx. the last two frames.
 When you play back movies on Windows, images and sound may 

become slightly out of synchronization.

Sample Histograms

The brightness histogram shows the exposure level distribution and 
overall brightness. The RGB histogram is for checking the color 
saturation and gradation. The display can be switched with [33: 
Histogram disp].
[Brightness] Display
This histogram is a graph showing the distribution 
of the image’s brightness level. The horizontal 
axis indicates the brightness level (darker on the 
left and brighter on the right), while the vertical 
axis indicates how many pixels exist for each 
brightness level. The more pixels there are 
toward the left, the darker the image. The more 
pixels there are toward the right, the brighter the 
image. If there are too many pixels on the left, the 
shadow detail will be lost. If there are too many 
pixels on the right, the highlight detail will be lost. 
The gradation in-between will be reproduced. By 
checking the image and its brightness histogram, 
you can see the exposure level inclination and the overall gradation.
[RGB] Display
This histogram is a graph showing the distribution of each primary 
color’s brightness level in the image (RGB or red, green, and blue). 
The horizontal axis indicates the color’s brightness level (darker on 
the left and brighter on the right), while the vertical axis indicates how 
many pixels exist for each color brightness level. The more pixels 
there are toward the left, the darker and less prominent the color. The 
more pixels there are toward the right, the brighter and denser the 
color. If there are too many pixels on the left, the respective color 
information will be lacking. If there are too many pixels on the right, 
the color will be too saturated with no gradation. By checking the 
image’s RGB histogram, you can see the color’s saturation and 
gradation condition, as well as white balance inclination.

R Processing RAW Images with the CameraN

 U Color space (p.181)

You can select either sRGB or Adobe RGB. Since the camera’s LCD 
monitor is not compatible with Adobe RGB, the difference in the 
image will hardly be perceptible when either color space is set.

 V Peripheral illumination correction (p.175)

A phenomenon that makes the image corners look darker due to the 
lens characteristics can be corrected. If [Enable] is set, the 
corrected image will be displayed. If the effect is difficult to discern, 
magnify the image (p.391) and check the four corners. The 
peripheral illumination correction applied with the camera will be less 
pronounced than that applied with the Digital Photo Professional 
(EOS software) at maximum correction amount. If the effects of 
correction are not apparent, use Digital Photo Professional to apply 
the peripheral illumination correction.

 W Distortion correction

Image distortion due to lens characteristics can be corrected. If 
[Enable] is set, the corrected image will be displayed. The image 
periphery will be trimmed in the corrected image.
Since the image resolution may look slightly lower, adjust the 
sharpness with the Picture Style’s [Sharpness] parameter setting as 
necessary.

 X Chromatic aberration correction (p.176)

Chromatic aberrations (color fringing along the subject’s outline) due 
to the lens characteristics can be corrected. If [Enable] is set, the 
corrected image will be displayed. If the effect is difficult to discern, 
magnify the image (p.391).

393

R Processing RAW Images with the CameraN

Peripheral Illumination Correction, Distortion Correction, and 
Chromatic Aberration Correction
To perform peripheral illumination correction, distortion correction, and 
chromatic aberration correction, the correction data of the lens used is 
necessary. If you cannot apply correction when processing RAW images in 
the camera, use EOS Utility (EOS software, p.512) to register the correction 
data to the camera.

 Processing RAW images in the camera will not produce exactly the 

same results as processing RAW images with Digital Photo Professional.
 When processing images with [Distortion correction] set to [Enable], 
AF point display information (p.352) or Dust Delete Data (p.405) will not 
be appended to the image.

Creative Filter Characteristics
 G Grainy B/W

Creates a grainy black-and-white photo. You can change the black-
and-white effect by adjusting the contrast.

 W Soft focus

Gives the image a soft look. You can change the degree of softness 
by adjusting the blur.

400

U Applying Creative Filters

 X Fish-eye effect

Gives the effect of a fish-eye lens. The image will have a barrel-type 
distortion.
Depending on the level of this filter effect, the area trimmed along 
the periphery of the image changes. Also, since this filter effect will 
magnify the image center, the apparent resolution at the center may 
degrade depending on the number of recorded pixels. Set the filter 
effect in step 4 while checking the resulting image.

 Y Art bold effect

Makes the photo look like an oil painting and the subject look more 
three-dimensional. You can adjust the contrast and saturation. Note 
that subjects such as the sky or white walls may not be rendered 
with a smooth gradation and may look irregular or noise will become 
more noticeable.

 Z Water painting effect

Makes the photo look like a watercolor painting with soft colors. You 
can control the color density by adjusting the filter effect. Note that 
some scenes including night scenes or low-light scenes may not be 
rendered with a smooth gradation and may look irregular or noise 
will become more noticeable.

 H Toy camera effect

Darkens the photo’s corners and applies a unique color tone that 
makes it look as if it was shot by a toy camera. You can change the 
color cast by adjusting the color tone.

 c Miniature effect

Creates a diorama effect. You can change where the image looks 
sharp. In step 4, if you press the <B> button (or tap on [T] at 
the screen’s bottom), you can switch between the white frame’s 
vertical and horizontal orientations.

Sensor Cleaning

The camera has a Self Cleaning Sensor Unit to 
automatically shake off dust adhered to the image 
sensor’s front layer (low pass filter).
The Dust Delete Data can also be appended to the 
image so that the dust spots remaining can be deleted 
automatically by Digital Photo Professional (EOS 
software, p.512).

Smudges adhering to the front of the sensor
Besides dust entering the camera from outside, in rare cases 
lubricant from the camera’s internal parts may adhere to the front of 
the sensor. If visible spots still remain after the automatic sensor 
cleaning, having the sensor cleaned by a Canon Service Center is 
recommended.

Even while the Self Cleaning Sensor Unit is operating, you can 
press the shutter button halfway to interrupt the cleaning and start 
shooting immediately.

403

f Automatic Sensor Cleaning
Whenever you set the power switch to <1> or <2>, the Self 
Cleaning Sensor Unit is activated to automatically shake off the dust on 
the front of the sensor. Normally, you need not pay attention to this 
operation. However, you can choose to perform sensor cleaning 
manually, or disable it.

cleaning], then press <0>.

 Under the [53] tab, select [Sensor 

2 Select [Clean nowf].

 Select [Clean nowf], then press 

<0>.

 Select [OK].
 The screen will indicate that the 

sensor is being cleaned. (A small 
sound may be heard.) Although there 
will be a shutter release sound during 
the cleaning, no picture is taken.

 For best results, perform the sensor cleaning with the camera placed 

upright and stable on a table or other flat surface.

 Even if you repeat the sensor cleaning, the result will not improve much. 

Immediately after the sensor cleaning is finished, the [Clean nowf] 
option remains disabled temporarily.

Disabling Automatic Sensor Cleaning
 In step 2, select [Auto cleaningf] and set it to [Disable].
 The sensor cleaning will no longer be performed when you set the 

power switch to <1> or <2>.

404

3 Appending Dust Delete DataN
Normally, the Self Cleaning Sensor Unit will eliminate most of the dust 
that may be visible on captured images. However, in case visible dust 
still remains, you can append the Dust Delete Data to the image for 
erasing the dust spots later. The Dust Delete Data is used by Digital 
Photo Professional (EOS software, p.512) to erase the dust spots 
automatically.

Preparation
 Prepare a solid white object such as a sheet of paper.
 Set the lens focal length to 50 mm or longer.
 Set the lens’s focus mode switch to <MF> and set the focus to 

infinity (u). If the lens has no distance scale, rotate the camera to 
face toward you and turn the focusing ring clockwise all the way.

Obtaining the Dust Delete Data

1 Select [Dust Delete Data].

 Under the [z3] tab, select [Dust 

Delete Data], then press <0>.

2 Select [OK].

 After the automatic self-cleaning of 
the sensor is performed, a message 
will appear. Although there will be a 
shutter release sound, during the 
cleaning, no picture is taken.

405

3 Appending Dust Delete DataN

3 Shoot a solid-white object.

 At a distance of 20 cm - 30 cm (0.7 ft. 

- 1.0 ft.), fill the viewfinder with a 
patternless, solid-white object and 
take a picture.

 The picture will be taken in aperture-

priority AE mode at an aperture of 
f/22.

 Since the image will not be saved, the 
data can still be obtained even if there 
is no card in the camera.

 When the picture is taken, the camera 

will start collecting the Dust Delete 
Data. When the Dust Delete Data is 
obtained, a message will appear.

 If the data is not obtained 

successfully, an error message will 
appear. Follow the “Preparation” 
procedure on the preceding page, 
then select [OK]. Take the picture 
again.

Dust Delete Data
After the Dust Delete Data is obtained, it is appended to all the JPEG 
and RAW images captured thereafter. Before an important shoot, it is 
recommended to update the Dust Delete Data by obtaining it again.
For details about using Digital Photo Professional (EOS software, 
p.512) to erase dust spots, refer to the Digital Photo Professional 
Instruction Manual.
The Dust Delete Data appended to the image is so small that it hardly 
affects the image file size.

Be sure to use a solid-white object such as a new sheet of white paper. If the 
object has any pattern or design, it may be recognized as dust data and 
affect the accuracy of the dust deletion with Digital Photo Professional (EOS 
software).

406

3 Manual Sensor CleaningN
Dust that could not be removed by the automatic sensor cleaning can 
be removed manually with a commercially-available blower, etc. Before 
cleaning the sensor, detach the lens from the camera.
The image sensor is extremely delicate. If the sensor needs to be 
cleaned directly, having it done by a Canon Service Center is 
recommended.

C.Fn II: Autofocus

C.Fn II -1

Tracking sensitivity

Sets the subject-tracking sensitivity during 
AI Servo AF when an obstacle cuts across 
the AF points or when the AF points stray 
from the subject.

0:  Default setting suited for most subjects. Suitable for moving 

subjects in general.

Locked on: -2 / Locked on: -1

The camera will try to continue focusing on the subject even if an 
obstacle cuts across the AF points or if the subject strays from the 
AF points. The -2 setting makes the camera keep tracking the 
target subject longer than the -1 setting.
However, if the camera focuses on a wrong subject, it may take 
slightly longer to switch and focus on the target subject.

Responsive: +2 / Responsive:+1

The camera can focus consecutively on subjects at different 
distances that are covered by the AF points. Also effective when 
you want to always focus on the closest subject. The +2 setting is 
more responsive than the +1 setting when focusing on the next 
subject.
However, the camera will be more prone to focus on an 
unintended subject.

[Tracking sensitivity] is the feature named [AI Servo tracking sensitivity] 
in the EOS-1D Mark III/IV, EOS-1Ds Mark III, and EOS 7D.

3 Custom Function SettingsN

C.Fn II -2

Acceleration/deceleration tracking

This sets the tracking sensitivity for moving 
subjects whose speed can momentarily 
change dramatically by starting or stopping 
suddenly, etc.

0: Suited for subjects that move at a steady speed (minor changes in 
+2 / +1:

moving speed).

Effective for subjects having sudden movements, sudden 
acceleration/deceleration, or sudden stops. Even if the moving 
subject’s speed suddenly changes dramatically, the camera continues 
to focus on the target subject. For example, for an approaching 
subject, the camera becomes less prone to focus behind it to avoid 
subject blur. For a subject stopping suddenly, the camera becomes 
less prone to focus in front of it. Setting +2 can track dramatic changes 
in the moving subject’s speed better than with +1.
However, since the camera will be sensitive to even slight movements 
of the subject, the focusing may be unstable momentarily.
C.Fn II -3

AF point auto switching

This sets the switching sensitivity of the AF 
points as they track the subject moving 
dramatically up, down, left, or right.
This setting takes effect when the AF area 
selection mode is set to Zone AF (manual 
selection of zone), Large Zone AF (manual 
selection of zone), or 45-point automatic 
selection AF.

0: Standard setting for gradual AF point switching.
+2 / +1:

Even if the target subject moves dramatically up, down, left, or right and 
moves away from the AF point, the camera switches its focus to neighboring 
AF points to continue focusing on the subject. The camera switches to the 
AF point deemed most likely to focus on the subject based on the subject’s 
continual movement, contrast, etc. Setting +2 makes the camera more prone

8: Fine Adjustment of AF’s Point of Focus
Fine adjustment of the AF’s point of focus is possible for viewfinder 
shooting. This is called “AF Microadjustment”. Before making the 
adjustment, read “General Cautions for AF Microadjustment” on page 
432.

Normally, this adjustment is not required. Perform this adjustment 
only if necessary. Note that performing this adjustment may prevent 
accurate focusing from being achieved.

1: Adjust All by Same Amount

8: Fine Adjustment of AF’s Point of Focus

When shooting with the intermediate range (focal length) of a zoom lens, the 
AF’s point of focus is corrected automatically relative to the adjustments 
made for the wide-angle and telephoto ends. Even if only the wide-angle or 
telephoto end has been adjusted, a correction will be made automatically for 
the intermediate range.

Clearing All AF Microadjustments
When [j Clear all] appears at the bottom of the screen, pressing the 
<L> button will clear all the adjustments made for [1: All by same 
amount] and [2: Adjust by lens].

General Cautions for AF Microadjustment
 The AF’s point of focus will vary slightly depending on the subject 

conditions, brightness, zoom position, and other shooting conditions. 
Therefore, even if you perform AF Microadjustment, focus may still not 
be achieved at the suitable position.

 The adjustment amount of one stop varies depending on the maximum 
aperture of the lens. Keep adjusting, shooting, and checking the focus 
repeatedly to adjust the AF’s point of focus.

 The adjustment will not be applied to AF during Live View shooting or 

movie shooting.

 If you clear all the Custom Function settings (p.410), the AF 

Microadjustment will be retained. However, the setting will become [0: 
Disable].

Notes for AF Microadjustment
 It is best to make the adjustment at the actual location where you will 

shoot. This will make the adjustment more precise.

 Using a tripod when making the adjustment is recommended.
 For making adjustments, shooting at the 73 image-recording quality is 

recommended.

H Using Eye-Fi Cards
With a commercially-available Eye-Fi card already set up, you can 
automatically transfer captured images to a computer or upload them to 
an online service via a wireless LAN.
The image transfer is a function of the Eye-Fi card. For instructions on 
how to set up and use the Eye-Fi card or to troubleshoot any image 
transfer problems, refer to the Eye-Fi card’s instruction manual or 
contact the card manufacturer.

The camera is not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card 
functions (including wireless transfer). In case of a problem 
with an Eye-Fi card, please check with the card manufacturer. 
Also note that approval is required to use Eye-Fi cards in 
many countries or regions. Without approval, use of the card 
is not permitted. If it is unclear whether the card has been 
approved for use in your area, please check with the card 
manufacturer.

H Using Eye-Fi Cards

Cautions for Using Eye-Fi Cards
 If [Wi-Fi/NFC] under [51: Wireless communication settings] is set to 

[Enable], image transfer with an Eye-Fi card is not possible.

 If “J” is displayed, an error occurred while retrieving the card 

information. Turn the camera’s power switch off and on again.

 Even if [Eye-Fi trans.] is set to [Disable], it may still transmit a signal. In 

hospitals, airports, and other places where wireless transmissions are 
prohibited, remove the Eye-Fi card from the camera.

 If the image transfer does not function, check the Eye-Fi card and 

computer settings. For details, refer to the card’s instruction manual.
 Depending on the wireless LAN’s connection conditions, the image 

transfer may take longer or it may be interrupted.
 The Eye-Fi card may become hot as it transmits.
 The camera’s battery power will be consumed faster.
 During the image transfer, auto power off will not take effect.
 If you insert a wireless LAN card other than an Eye-Fi card, [Eye-Fi 

settings] will not appear. Also, the transmission status icon <H> will not 
appear.

Troubleshooting Guide
If a problem occurs with the camera, first consult this Troubleshooting 
Guide. If this Troubleshooting Guide does not resolve the problem, 
contact your dealer or nearest Canon Service Center.

Power-Related Problems

The battery does not recharge.
 If the battery’s remaining capacity is 94% or higher, the battery will not 

be recharged (p.452).

 Do not use any battery other than a genuine Battery Pack LP-E6N/LP-

E6.

The charger’s lamp blinks at high speed.
 If (1) the battery charger or battery has a problem or (2) communication 
with the battery failed (with a non-Canon battery), the protection circuit 
will stop charging, and the charge lamp will blink in orange at a high 
speed. In the case of (1), unplug the charger’s power plug from the 
power outlet. Detach and reattach the battery to the charger. Wait a few 
minutes, then reconnect the power plug to the power outlet. If the 
problem persists, contact your dealer or nearest Canon Service Center.

The charger’s lamp does not blink.
 If the internal temperature of the battery attached to the charger is high, 

the charger will not charge the battery for safety reasons (lamp off). If 
the battery temperature becomes high for any reason during charging, 
the charging will stop automatically (lamp blinks). When the battery 
temperature goes down, the charging will resume automatically.

The camera does not operate even when the power switch is set to <1>.
 Make sure the battery is installed properly in the camera (p.36).
 Make sure the battery compartment cover is closed (p.36).
 Make sure the card slot cover is closed (p.37).
 Recharge the battery (p.34).

481

Troubleshooting Guide

The access lamp still lights or blinks 
even when the power switch is <2>.
 If the power is turned off while an image is being recorded to the card, the 
access lamp will remain on/continue to blink for a few seconds. When the 
image recording is completed, the power will turn off automatically.

[Does this battery/do these batteries display the Canon 
logo?] is displayed.
 Do not use any battery other than a genuine Battery Pack LP-E6N/LP-E6.
 Remove and install the battery again (p.36).
 If the electrical contacts are dirty, use a soft cloth to clean them.

The battery becomes exhausted quickly.
 Use a fully-charged battery (p.34).
 The battery performance may have degraded. See [53: Battery info.] 

to check the battery’s recharge performance level (p.452). If the 
battery performance is poor, replace the battery with a new one.

 The number of possible shots will decrease with any of the following 

operations:
• Pressing the shutter button halfway for a prolonged period.
• Activating the AF frequently without taking a picture.
• Using the lens’s Image Stabilizer.
• Using the LCD monitor frequently.
• Continuing Live View shooting or movie shooting for a prolonged 

period.

• The Eye-Fi card’s communication function is enabled.

The camera turns off by itself.
 Auto power off is in effect. If you do not want auto power off to take 

effect, set [52: Auto power off] to [Disable] (p.66).

 Even if [52: Auto power off] is set to [Disable], the LCD monitor will 

still turn off after the camera is left idle for approx. 30 min. (The 
camera’s power does not turn off.)

482

Troubleshooting Guide

Shooting-Related Problems

The lens cannot be attached.
 The camera cannot be used with EF-M lenses (p.47).

The viewfinder is dark.
 Install a recharged battery in the camera (p.34).

No images can be shot or recorded.
 Make sure if the card is properly inserted (p.37).
 Slide the card’s write-protect switch to the write/erase position (p.37).
 If the card is full, replace the card or delete unnecessary images to 

make space (p.37, 378).

 If you try to focus in the One-Shot AF mode and the focus indicator 
<o> in the viewfinder blinks, a picture cannot be taken. Press the 
shutter button halfway again to refocus automatically, or focus 
manually (p.50, 137).

The card cannot be used.
 If a card error message is displayed, see page 39 or 496.

I cannot lock the focus and recompose the shot.
 Set the AF operation to One-Shot AF. Focus lock is not possible in the 

AI Servo AF mode or when servo takes effect in AI Focus AF mode 
(p.118).

483

Troubleshooting Guide

The image is out of focus or blurred.
 Set the lens’s focus mode switch to <AF> (p.47).
 Press the shutter button gently to prevent camera shake (p.49-50).
 If the lens has an Image Stabilizer, set the IS switch to <1>.
 In low light, the shutter speed may become slow. Use a faster shutter 
speed (p.192), set a higher ISO speed (p.148), use flash (p.228, 233), 
or use a tripod.

There are fewer AF points.
 Depending on the attached lens, the number of usable AF points and 
patterns varies. The lenses are categorized into eight groups from A to 
H. Check which group your lens belongs to. Using a lens in Groups E 
to H will have fewer usable AF points (p.130-131).

The AF point is blinking.
 Regarding lighting up or blinking of the AF points when you press the 

<S> button, see page 123.

The AF points do not light up in red.
 The AF points light up in red only when focus is achieved in low-light 

conditions.

 In Creative Zone modes, you can set whether to have the AF points 

light up in red when focus is achieved (p.424).

484

Troubleshooting Guide

The continuous shooting speed is slow.
 The continuous shooting speed may become slower depending on the 
shutter speed, aperture, subject conditions, brightness, lens, flash use, 
temperature, battery type, remaining battery level, shooting function 
settings, etc. For details, see page 139.

With FlexiZone - Multi, it takes longer to focus.
 Depending on the shooting conditions, it may take longer to focus on 

the subject. Use FlexiZone - Single or focus manually.

The maximum burst during continuous shooting is lower.
 If you shoot something that has fine detail such as a field of grass, the 

file size will be larger, and the actual maximum burst may be lower 
than the number listed on page 143.

ISO 100 cannot be set. ISO speed expansion 
cannot be selected.
 When [z3: Highlight tone priority] is set to [Disable], ISO100/125/

160 can be set (p.174).

 If [z3: Highlight tone priority] is set to [Enable], the settable ISO 

speed range will be ISO 200 - ISO 16000 (or up to ISO 12800 for 
movie shooting). Even if you expand the settable ISO speed range in 
[Range for stills] or [Range for movies], you cannot set expanded 
ISO speeds (H).

Troubleshooting Guide

Even though I set a decreased exposure compensation, 
the image comes out bright.
 Set [z2: Auto Lighting Optimizer] to [Disable]. When [Low], 

[Standard], or [High] is set, even if you set a decreased exposure 
compensation or flash exposure compensation, the image may come 
out bright (p.169).

The multiple-exposure image is shot in 1 quality.
 When the image-recording quality is set to 41 or 61, the 
multiple-exposure image will be recorded in 1 quality (p.218).

When I use the <f> mode with flash, 
the shutter speed becomes slow.
 If you shoot at night when the background is dark, the shutter speed 

automatically becomes slow (slow-sync shooting) so that both the 
subject and background are properly exposed. To prevent a slow 
shutter speed, under [z1: Flash control], set [Flash sync. speed in 
Av mode] to [1/250-1/60sec. auto] or [1/250 sec. (fixed)] (p.236).

The built-in flash rises by itself.
 In shooting modes (<A> <C> <8: C624> 

<v: GWXHcZ>) whose default setting is <a> (Auto built-in 
flash firing), the built-in flash will be raised automatically when 
necessary.

 In the <8: xG> and <v: ABCD> modes, when you 

press the shutter button halfway under low-light conditions, the built-in 
flash may be raised automatically and emit the AF-assist beam.

486

Troubleshooting Guide

The built-in flash does not fire.
 If you use the built-in flash too often in too short a period of time, the 

flash may stop firing for a while to protect the light-emitting unit.

The external flash does not fire.
 If you use a non-Canon flash unit with Live View shooting, set [z6: 

Silent LV shoot.] to [Disable] (p.272).

The external flash always fires at full output.
 If you use a flash unit other than an EX-series Speedlite, the flash will 

always be fired at full output (p.234).

 When the external Speedlite’s [Flash metering mode] Custom 

Function is set to [TTL] (autoflash), the flash will always be fired at full 
output (p.243).

Flash exposure compensation cannot be set 
for the external Speedlite.
 If flash exposure compensation is set with the external Speedlite, flash 

exposure compensation cannot be set with the camera. When the 
external Speedlite’s flash exposure compensation is canceled (set to 
0), flash exposure compensation can be set with the camera.

High-speed sync cannot be set in the <f> mode.
 Under [z1: Flash control], set [Flash sync. speed in Av mode] to 

[Auto] (p.236).

487

Troubleshooting Guide

The camera makes a noise when it is shaken.
 The built-in flash’s pop-up mechanism moves slightly. This is normal 

and not a malfunction.

The shutter makes two shutter release 
sounds during Live View shooting.
 If you use flash, the shutter will make two shutter release sounds each 

time you shoot (p.257).

During Live View shooting, a white <s> or 
red <E> icon is displayed.
 It indicates that the camera’s internal temperature is high. If the white 
<s> icon is displayed, the still photo’s image quality may deteriorate. 
If the red <E> icon is displayed, it indicates that the Live View 
shooting will soon stop automatically (p.290).

During movie shooting, a red E icon is displayed.
 It indicates that the camera’s internal temperature is high. If the red 
<E> icon is displayed, it indicates that the movie shooting will soon 
stop automatically (p.343).

Movie shooting stops by itself.
 If the card’s writing speed is slow, movie shooting may stop 

automatically. For cards that can record movies, see page 5. To find 
out the card’s writing speed, refer to the card manufacturer’s Web site.
 If the movie shooting time reaches 29 min. 59 sec., the movie shooting 

will stop automatically.

488

Troubleshooting Guide

The ISO speed cannot be set for movie shooting.
 In shooting modes other than <a>, the ISO speed is set 

automatically. In the <a> mode, you can freely set the ISO speed 
(p.299).

The manually set ISO speed changes when 
switching to movie shooting.
 ISO speed will be set according to the setting for [Range for stills] 

during viewfinder shooting and Live View shooting, or that for [Range 
for movies] during movie shooting with manual exposure.

The exposure changes during movie shooting.
 If you change the shutter speed or aperture during movie shooting, the 

changes in the exposure may be recorded.

 Zooming the lens during movie shooting may cause changes in the 

exposure regardless of whether the lens’s maximum aperture changes 
or not. The changes in the exposure may be recorded as a result.

The subject looks distorted during movie shooting.
 If you move the camera to the left or right quickly or shoot a moving 

subject, the image may look distorted. The problem may be more 
noticeable in time-lapse movie shooting.

The image flickers or horizontal stripes appear 
during movie shooting.
 Flickering, horizontal stripes (noise), or irregular exposures can be 
caused by fluorescent lighting, LED lighting, or other light sources 
during movie shooting. Also, changes in the exposure (brightness) or 
color tone may be recorded. In the <a> mode, a slow shutter speed 
may reduce the problem. The problem may be more noticeable in 
time-lapse movie shooting.

489

Troubleshooting Guide

Wireless Functions

Wireless functions cannot be set.
 If the camera is connected to a computer, GPS receiver, or other 

device with an interface cable, wireless functions cannot be set ([51: 
Wireless communication settings] will be grayed out). Disconnect 
the interface cable before changing any settings.

 Refer to the Wireless Function Instruction Manual.

Operation Problems

I cannot change the setting with the <6>, <5>, <9>, 
or touch screen.
 Set the <R> switch downward (lock release, p.54).
 Check the [54: Multi function lock] setting (p.54).

A camera button or dial does not work as expected.
 Check the [8C.Fn III -4: Custom Controls] setting (p.433).

During touch screen operations, the beeper suddenly 
sounds softer.
 Check if your finger is blocking the speaker (p.26).

Touch screen operation is not possible.
 Check if [53: Touch control] is set to [Standard] or [Sensitive] 

(p.63).

490

Troubleshooting Guide

Display Problems

The menu screen shows fewer tabs and options.
 In Basic Zone modes, certain tabs and menu options are not 

displayed. Set the shooting mode to a Creative Zone mode (p.58).

 Under the [9] tab, [Menu display] is set to [Display only My Menu 

tab] (p.444).

The file name’s first character is an underscore (“_”).
 Set the color space to sRGB. If Adobe RGB is set, the first character 

will be an underscore (p.181).

The file name starts with “MVI_”.
 It is a movie file (p.185).

The file numbering does not start from 0001.
 If the card already contains recorded images, the image number may 

not start from 0001 (p.184).

The shooting date and time displayed is incorrect.
 Make sure the correct date and time are set (p.43).
 Check the time zone and daylight saving time (p.43).

The date and time are not in the image.
 The shooting date and time do not appear in the image. The date and 
time are instead recorded in the image data as shooting information. 
When printing, you can imprint the date and time in the picture, using 
the date and time recorded in the shooting information (p.380).

491

Troubleshooting Guide

[###] is displayed.
 If the number of images recorded on the card exceeds the number the 

camera can display, [###] will be displayed (p.360).

In the viewfinder, the AF point display speed is slow.
 In low temperatures, the display speed of the AF points may become 
slower due to the AF point display device’s characteristics. The display 
speed will return to normal at room temperature.

The LCD monitor does not display a clear image.
 If the LCD monitor is dirty, use a soft cloth to clean it.
 In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem slow 

or may look black. It will return to normal at room temperature.

[Eye-Fi settings] does not appear.
 [Eye-Fi settings] will appear only when an Eye-Fi card is inserted in 

the camera. If the Eye-Fi card has a write-protect switch set to the 
<LOCK> position, you will not be able to check the card’s connection 
status or disable Eye-Fi transmission (p.457).

Playback Problems

Part of the image blinks in black.
 [33: Highlight alert] is set to [Enable] (p.351).

A red box is displayed on the image.
 [33: AF point disp.] is set to [Enable] (p.352).

492

Troubleshooting Guide

The image cannot be erased.
 If the image is protected, it cannot be erased (p.376).

The movie cannot be played back.
 Movies edited with a computer cannot be played back with the camera.

Operation sound and mechanical sound 
can be heard during movie playback.
 If you operate the camera’s dials or lens during movie shooting, the 
operation sound will also be recorded. Using the Directional Stereo 
Microphone DM-E1 (sold separately) is recommended (p.313).

The movie appears to freeze momentarily.
 If there is a drastic change in the exposure level during autoexposure 

movie shooting, the recording will stop momentarily until the 
brightness stabilizes. In such a case, shoot in <a> mode (p.298).

No picture on the TV set.
 Make sure the [53: Video system] is correctly set to [For NTSC] or 

[For PAL] (depending on the video system of your TV set).

 Make sure the HDMI cable’s plug is inserted all the way in (p.373).

There are multiple movie files for a single movie shoot.
 If the movie file size reaches 4 GB, another movie file will be created 

automatically (p.309).

My card reader does not recognize the card.
 Depending on the card reader and computer OS used, SDXC cards 

may not be correctly recognized. In such a case, connect your camera 
to the computer with the interface cable, then transfer the images to 
the computer using EOS Utility (EOS software, p.512).

493

Troubleshooting Guide

I cannot process the RAW image.
 41 and 61 images cannot be processed with the camera. Use 

Digital Photo Professional (EOS software) to process the image 
(p.512).

I cannot resize or crop the image.
 JPEG c, 1, 41, and 61 images cannot be resized or 

cropped with the camera (p.395).

The shutter makes a noise during sensor cleaning.
 If you selected [Clean nowf], the shutter will make a noise, but no 

picture is taken (p.404).

Automatic sensor cleaning does not work.
 If you repeatedly turn the power switch <1> / <2> at a short 

interval, the <f> icon may not be displayed (p.41).

494

Troubleshooting Guide

Computer Connection Problems

Communication between the connected camera and 
computer does not work.
 When using EOS Utility (EOS software), set [z5: Time-lapse movie] 

to [Disable] (p.319).

I cannot download images to a computer.
 Install the EOS software on the computer (p.513).
